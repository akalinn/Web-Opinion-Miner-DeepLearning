After all, they don\u2019t have a replacement, and never will. They\u2019ve spent seven years promising something very different from yet better than Obamacare, but keep failing to deliver, because they can\u2019t; the logic of broad coverage, especially for those with pre-existing conditions, requires either an Obamacare-like system or single-payer, which Republicans like even less. That won\u2019t change. As a result, repeal would have devastating effects, with people who voted Trump among the biggest losers. Independent estimates suggest that Republican plans would cause 30 million Americans to lose coverage, with about half the losers coming from the Trump-supporting white working class. At least some of those Trump supporters would probably conclude that they were the victims of a political scam \u2014 which they were. Republican congressional leaders like Paul Ryan nonetheless seem eager to push ahead with repeal. In fact, they seem to be in a great rush, probably because they\u2019re afraid that if they don\u2019t unravel health reform in the very first weeks of the Trump era, rank-and-file members of Congress will start hearing from constituents who really, really don\u2019t want to lose their insurance. Why do the Republicans hate health reform? Some of the answer is that Obamacare was paid for in part with taxes on the wealthy, who will reap a huge windfall if it\u2019s repealed, even as many middle-income families face tax hikes. More broadly, Obamacare must die precisely because it\u2019s working, showing that government action really can improve people\u2019s lives \u2014 a truth they don\u2019t want anyone to know. Advertisement Continue reading the main story How will Republicans try to contain the political fallout if they go ahead with repeal, and tens of millions lose access to health care? No doubt they\u2019ll try to distract the public \u2014 and the all-too-compliant news media \u2014 with shiny objects of various kinds. But surely a central aspect of their damage control will be an attempt to push a false narrative about Obamacare\u2019s past. Health reform, they\u2019ll claim, was always a failure, and it was already collapsing on the eve of the G.O.P. takeover. When the number of uninsured Americans skyrockets on their watch, they\u2019ll claim that it\u2019s not their fault \u2014 like everything, it\u2019s the fault of liberal elites. So let\u2019s refute that narrative in advance. Obamacare has, in fact, been a big success \u2014 imperfect, yes, but it has greatly improved (and saved) many lives. And all indications are that this success is sustainable, that the teething problems of health reform weren\u2019t fatal and were well on their way to being solved at the end of 2016. If, as seems all too likely, a health care debacle is imminent, blame must be placed where it belongs: on Donald Trump and the people who put him over the top.",

But instead of listing every covered service in the act itself, the law left that task to regulators in the Department of Health and Human Services. They, in turn, relied on a study based on a review by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) that recommended several categories of services: well-woman visits, screening for gestational diabetes, counseling for sexually transmitted infections, breast-feeding support, screening and counseling for domestic violence, and \u2014 most at risk of repeal now \u2014 contraceptive methods and counseling.

Recognizing that contraceptive services is a sensitive cultural and political issue, the Obama administration exempted houses of worship from the coverage requirement and created an accommodation for religious nonprofits. This requirement spurred litigation that ended up in the Supreme Court twice and resulted in some for-profit businesses\u2019 being able to opt out of the requirement, too. Such care goes beyond reproductive health. The only doctor many women see regularly is a gynecologist, and in 35 states OB/GYNs can be a woman\u2019s Medicaid primary care provider. Moreover, 62 percent of all women of reproductive age use a contraceptive method, and 99 percent of women ages 15 to 44 who have ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method. In contrast, only 18 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64 visit an emergency room at least once each year. Yet no one doubts the importance of emergency coverage. Obamacare did not invent the use of legal mandates to cover contraception. Before its enactment, 28 states required contraception coverage, and 85 percent of large employers provided it. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission declared in 2000 that any health plan that covered drugs, devices and preventive care but that did not cover contraceptives violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. So even if the new health secretary were to repeal the law\u2019s contraceptive coverage requirement, many insurance plans would still cover it. But state contraceptive coverage mandates don\u2019t reach everyone, and they don\u2019t address costs. Women in the 22 states without a mandate or working for the employers that did not cover contraception before the Affordable Care Act would have to pay the full cost on their own. Women know what is at stake. That is why they have been rushing to see their doctors and to fill prescriptions before Mr. Trump takes office in January. Paradoxically, cutting women\u2019s health care services is contrary to Republican goals. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s health plan states, \u201cPrevention requires efforts and investments today that are expected to provide long-term cost savings and other benefits.\u201d That is exactly what covering contraception does: provide women significant benefits to their health and socioeconomic status, while in many cases saving money for the health care system over all. Voters understand this. A majority of people, including two-thirds of women, support private health plans\u2019 covering the full cost of birth control.

On the other hand, some of his cabinet picks are a little more ideologically unknowable (like Steven Mnuchin at Treasury), and his inner circle remains highly unconventional. Stephen K. Bannon is intent on remaking the G.O.P. along nationalist lines, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump seem eager for their paterfamilias to negotiate with Democrats, Peter Navarro is girding for a trade war with China. And Trump\u2019s foreign policy choices \u2014 especially Rex Tillerson at State \u2014 seem closer to full-Trumpist realpolitik than to Reaganism-as-usual. On the governance axis, the president-elect\u2019s strong-arming of the private sector, his media-bashing tweets, and his feud with the intelligence community all hint at an authoritarian timeline ahead. Likewise, other fact patterns \u2014 that Congressional Republicans are mostly supine, that the stock market has surged \u2014 suggest that Trump could be authoritarian, corrupt and politically effective. But anyone who fears incompetence more than tyranny has plenty of evidence as well. Trump\u2019s tweets might be a sign, not of an incipient autocrat, but of an unstable narcissist who will undermine himself at every step. He has no cushion in popular opinion: If things go even somewhat badly, his political capital will go very fast indeed. He has plenty of hacks, wild cards and misfit toys occupying positions of real responsibility \u2014 and his White House has already had its first sex scandal! Then, finally, there is the question of how the axes interact. A populist-authoritarian combination might seem natural, with Trump using high-profile deviations from conservative orthodoxy to boost his popularity even as he runs roughshod over republican norms. But you could also imagine an authoritarian-orthodox conservative combination, in which Congressional Republicans accept the most imperial of presidencies because it\u2019s granting them tax rates and entitlement reforms they have long desired.

As for what we should actually hope for \u2013 well, the midpoint of each axis, the center of the matrix, seems like the sweet spot for the country: A Trump presidency that\u2019s competent-enough without being dictatorial, and that provides a needed populist corrective to conservatism without taking us all the way to mercantilism or a debt crisis. But this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so a happy medium seems unlikely. Along one axis or the other, bet on the extremes.",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story But you have alternatives. The crucial first step is to avoid repealing the insurance expansion without simultaneously replacing it. The new Congress comes to Washington next week, and its members should know where you stand from the beginning. It won\u2019t work to promise millions of people health insurance on spec. If you avoid this trap, you can then push both parties toward a different version of universal health coverage. \u201cThere is a ton of policy space for compromise,\u201d as Bagley says. \u201cThere is room for a really interesting discussion and potentially a breakthrough that could rebrand Obamacare and replace some of the portions of it that most set Republican teeth on edge.\u201d You will like this, Mr. President-elect: Bagley also says you are \u201cthe kind of politician who could cut a really interesting deal.\u201d That deal could give states more flexibility to meet the top-line coverage goals. It could rely more heavily on subsidies to bring healthy people into the market \u2014 and ultimately scrap the mandate. It could permit insurers to charge young people less (and older people more). It could create incentives for personal responsibility, allowing higher prices for people who have voluntarily gone without insurance. I will be honest that I do not favor some of these ideas and worry that they would cause hardships. But I was not elected president, and you were. And all of these ideas are within the realm of serious debate about our health care system. For your sake and the country\u2019s, I hope you insist that Congress deals in reality.

His choice as labor secretary is a fast-food tycoon who has been a vociferous opponent both of Obamacare and of minimum wage hikes. And House Republicans have already submitted plans for drastic cuts in Social Security, including a sharp rise in the retirement age. What would these policies do? Obamacare led to big declines in the number of the uninsured in regions that voted Trump this year, and repealing it would undo all those gains. The nonpartisan Urban Institute estimates that repeal would cause 30 million Americans \u2014 16 million of them non-Hispanic whites \u2014 to lose health coverage. And no, there won\u2019t be a \u201cterrific\u201d replacement: Republican plans would cover only a fraction as many people as the law they would displace, and they\u2019d be different people \u2014 younger, healthier and richer. Converting Medicare into a voucher system would also amount to a severe benefit cut, partly because it would lead to lower government spending, partly because a significant fraction of spending would be diverted into the overhead and profits of private insurance companies. And raising the retirement age for Social Security would hit especially hard among Americans whose life expectancy has stagnated or declined, or who have disabilities that make it hard for them to continue working \u2014 problems that are strongly correlated with Trump votes. In other words, the movement that\u2019s about to take power here isn\u2019t the same as Europe\u2019s far-right movements.

        "parsed_article": "Photo Where should Democrats head after their recent electoral rout? As it happens, coming fights about federally subsidized health insurance offer the party a golden opportunity to engage people far beyond its urban strongholds, in communities that will be hard hit by Republican plans to shrink Medicaid, privatize Medicare and eliminate the taxes that pay for Obamacare subsidies. Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College, and Republicans maintained congressional majorities, because of overwhelming victories in small cities, outer suburbs and rural counties. Yet the president-elect and the Republicans are poised to deliver blows to the social fabric and economic underpinnings of those very communities. Along with Representative Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, congressional Republicans say they want to move quickly to revolutionize all types of federal health insurance spending, using special procedures that require only 51 votes in the Senate. Congress will be asked not only to cut the taxes levied on businesses and the rich to finance Obamacare benefits for 20 to 30 million low and middle-income Americans; Republican leaders also plan to slash federal commitments to Medicaid, giving states the authority to shrink this health care program for the poor and elderly. And Republican House members, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seem determined to abolish traditional Medicare insurance for retirees and replace it with \u201cpremium vouchers\u201d that would throw older Americans on the mercies of private insurance markets and require them to pay more for their care. Trump voters will be especially hard hit if just part of this sweeping agenda comes to fruition. Conservatives often point to poor blacks and Latinos as the primary beneficiaries of federal health insurance programs. But such rhetoric obscures the enormous importance of Medicaid, Medicare and Obamacare subsidies to economically struggling white Americans living in small cities and rural areas. In Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton with overwhelming support outside big cities, about 17 percent of residents are 65 or older, above the national average. Meanwhile, some 16 percent of Pennsylvanians benefit from Medicare, and 18 percent from Medicaid. With the bulk of Medicaid going to elderly and disabled residents, that program is the single largest federal subsidy flowing into the Keystone State.

Under the act, some 468,000 low-income Pennsylvanians had gained Medicaid coverage by August 2016, and another 439,000 bought private coverage on the Obamacare marketplace, with more than three-fourths of those people getting tax credits averaging $251 per month. Health care is often sparse in nonurban areas, and the providers that do exist depend on federal insurance programs that help many patients pay for care. If radical Republican cutbacks in federal contributions to health insurance are enacted, Pennsylvania hospitals and health care businesses will lose vital revenues, leaving many lower-income and sick Pennsylvanians at risk of losing access to care. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is the case in other states as well, meaning many rural and small-town Trump supporters may soon see that Make America Great Again means accelerating economic decline and social devastation. Mr. Trump shows little understanding of the intricate interplay of subsidies and rules in the health care system, and probably has no inkling that federal taxes collected from liberal states like California, Massachusetts and New York heavily subsidize vital health services, businesses and family benefits in the very places that voted heavily for him. In delegating plans for huge health care cutbacks to hard-right congressional Republicans, he will be hurting his own base.",

Mr. Obama\u2019s retort underscores a troubling truth: Mr. Trump\u2019s vast ignorance of black life leads him to exaggerate the perils confronting black Americans in all the wrong ways. He overlooks the nation\u2019s vicious history of racism to proclaim that this is the worst racial epoch ever. It is a convenient ruse to make the period under President Obama a foil to his heroic rescue of black people through his magical political powers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The road ahead is not easy, primarily because Mr. Trump\u2019s ignorance about race, his critical lack of nuance and learning about it, exists among liberals and the white left, too. From the start of his 2016 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders was prickly about race, uncomfortable with an outspoken, demanding blackness, resistant to letting go of his preference for discussing class over race. He made efforts to improve the way he spoke about the realities of racial discrimination. But Mr. Sanders seemed to remain at heart a man of the people, especially if those people were the white working class. Since the election, Mr. Sanders has sounded an increasingly familiar theme among liberals that they should \u201cgo beyond identity politics.\u201d He warned that \u201cto think of diversity purely in racial and gender terms is not sufficient,\u201d and that we need candidates \u201cto be fighters for the working class and stand up to the corporate powers who have so much power over our economic lives.\u201d In a recent speech in California, Mr. Sanders said that it is \u201cvery easy for many Americans to say, I hate racism, I hate homophobia, I hate sexism,\u201d but that \u201cit is a little bit harder for people in the middle or upper middle class to say, maybe we do have to deal with the greed of Wall Street.\u201d This is a nifty bit of historical revisionism. For the longest time there was little consideration for diversity, even among liberal elites, much less the white middle and working classes. It seems more than a little reactionary to blame the loss of the election on a brand of identity politics that even liberals were slow to embrace. Attention to diversity and identity does not undercut our nation\u2019s embrace of democratic ideals; it strengthens them. The black struggle for freedom has ensured that other groups could follow along in the wake of our demand for equality. When the 1964 civil rights bill was in doubt in Congress, white opponents of the bill thought they could sink it by attaching the issue of gender, hoping to appeal to the sexism of those who might otherwise be cajoled to offer their support. Instead, the bill passed, and paved the way for both black rights and those of women. What\u2019s good for black people is good for the nation. When it comes to the white working class, however, that is almost impossible to see. The interests of the white working class have often been used by white political elites to stave off challenges to inequality and discrimination by black folk and other minority groups. In the middle of the 20th century, labor unions curtailed opportunity for black workers by protecting the race-based interests of the white working and middle class. In the late 1960s, Richard M. Nixon even supported a version of affirmative action because he deemed it useful to break unions by accusing them of racial exclusion. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan appealed to disaffected white Democrats who resented being forced to share a small measure of the gains they had accumulated through bigotry and often official discrimination. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now we hear again the cry that the neglected white working class is the future of American progressive politics. The tragedy is that much of the professed concern about the white working class is a cover for the interests of white elites who evoke working-class solidarity to combat racial, sexual and gender progress. Identity has always been at the heart of American culture. We must confront a truth that we have assiduously avoided: The most protected, cherished and nurtured identity of all has been white identity. After all, the needs of the black and brown working classes, which are not exclusively urban, are, again, even in progressive quarters, all but forgotten. Mr. Trump, and to a degree, the liberals and progressives who advocate a vision of America that spurns identity politics, make one thing clear: The real unifying force in American political life is whiteness, no matter its party, gender, region or, at times, even its class.",

The hatred, racism and sexism stoked in this election worsen mental illness and must not be ignored. JEFFREY B.

There seemed to be a brief glimmer of hope when, last month, Mr. Trump suggested that he was open to keeping the rules about coverage for pre-existing conditions even after getting rid of Obamacare. But Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, cast doubt on that. Mr. Price has proposed that insurers be required to cover pre-existing conditions only so long as an individual has had continuous coverage for the past year and a half. But many people with mental illness have lapses in employment and could easily fall through the cracks under a plan like that. Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect. No legislative action can erase the stigma surrounding mental illness, which is a major barrier to getting good treatment. Nor can it solve the serious shortage of mental health specialists or the limited access to psychiatric treatment, especially in rural areas. Still, if President-elect Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the law, he will effectively strip millions of Americans with mental illness overnight of the most medically rational and humane benefits they have ever had \u2014 without giving them any indication of what, if anything, will replace them. The consequences would be quick and devastating. Psychiatrically ill Americans who lost their coverage would be forced to seek treatment in emergency rooms, causing a meteoric rise in health care costs. And untreated mental disorders like depression, bipolar illness and schizophrenia would almost certainly lead to higher suicide rates. The current annual cost to society of treating depression alone is $210 billion \u2014 60 percent of which represents reduced efficiency at work and costs related to suicide. With a reduction in mental health care, this bill will balloon. In other words, untreated mental illness is not just a source of individual morbidity, mortality and immense suffering; it is also a largely preventable drain on our economy. There is at least one more reason to worry about mental health in the age of Trump. Mr. Trump has said that Congress should give each state a lump sum of federal money for Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income people. This would effectively roll back the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, which provided coverage to an additional 12 million people in 31 states. Since people with mental illness are far more likely to receive public insurance like Medicaid than private insurance, this will hurt them disproportionately. America can\u2019t be great if millions of our citizens with medical and psychiatric illnesses lose their insurance coverage. An anxious nation is rooting for Mr. Trump not to let that happen.",

ROBERT MILLSAP Woodland, Calif. To the Editor: While Republicans in Congress debate \u201crepeal and replace\u201d health care for millions of us, what about their guaranteed health care? That\u2019s an entitlement program to question. Why do members of Congress have better guaranteed health care than the people whom they represent? Let\u2019s ask them how they would like the changes they are considering proposing for us. Would they like their health care insurance program repealed and gradually replaced? Would they enjoy health savings accounts? If they were not re-elected, they might need to seek another job. Would they want their pre-existing conditions to possibly not be covered by their next insurer? BARBARA ELER New Milford, Conn. To the Editor: It\u2019s the height of hypocrisy for the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, to complain of Democrats \u201cplaying politics\u201d with Obamacare and to call for good-faith negotiation. Republicans had the opportunity for this discussion in 2009 when President Obama articulated his openness to any proposal that expanded coverage without adding to the debt. They could readily have obtained many of the adjustments they now propose had they been willing to engage at that time. Instead they opted for calculated party-line opposition focused entirely on handing the president a political defeat, and outrageous anti-Obamacare hyperbole has poisoned the discussion in the years since. By all means let\u2019s stop playing politics, but this means abandoning the overheated and vacuous repeal rhetoric and engaging in good-faith discussion on possible adjustments to the existing framework, not playing chicken with the coverage for millions of people.

The operational costs alone to implement the changes bandied about by Speaker Paul Ryan and Tom Price, the nominee to head Health and Human Services, would be staggering. Every state would be affected, many of which are still upgrading their state-funded and federally subsidized programs to accommodate Obamacare policies. A bit of prognostication: Since Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201crepeal and replace\u201d approach to Obamacare has morphed into \u201crepeal and delay,\u201d the \u201crepeal\u201d bills will pass easily in both the Senate and the House.

It\u2019s been equally clear that the most troublesome parts are (B) forcing people to buy health insurance, paying for the subsidies the system requires and keeping health care costs down.

        "parsed_article": "There are now a growing number of theoretically less expensive health care options that don\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act. I could, for instance, join a local membership-based primary care provider clinic \u2014 around $200 a month for a family of three \u2014 and combine it with a similarly priced catastrophic-coverage plan. But these options still leave gaps in your coverage, and subject you to a fine for not carrying proper insurance \u2014 up to 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. There is, though, one more option available to me. For only $500 a month \u2014 a saving of $8,400 a year in premiums over the Anthem plan we are considering \u2014 I could purchase coverage through a \u201cfaith-based plan\u201d called Altrua HealthShare. Officially known as \u201chealth care sharing ministries,\u201d such plans are not, strictly speaking, insurance. According to the Alliance of Health Sharing Ministries, \u201cThe purpose of the ministry is simply to organize other people who voluntarily choose to help fellow members pay their medical bills in keeping with biblical commands to \u2018share one another\u2019s burdens.\u2019 \u201d But in practice, the ministries serve much the same function as insurance. Members pay a monthly contribution, they are subject to an annual deductible (in this case, $1,000 per person) and their doctor submits a claim and is reimbursed by the plan. Faith-based plans do not adhere to the same rules as Obamacare insurance plans. They don\u2019t have to pay for preventive care, they may not insure smokers, they may not cover pre-existing conditions, and they may deny you admission based on your weight. If you are a 5-foot-6 woman and weigh more than 230 pounds, for instance, Altrua HealthShare won\u2019t offer you membership. Unlike the other non-A.C.A.-compliant options, though, health care sharing ministries are actually exempt from the law. (These organizations have to meet certain requirements, and must have been in existence continuously since 1999.) That means if you sign up for one, you aren\u2019t subject to the fines. While some health sharing ministries require membership in a Christian congregation, Altrua HealthShare does not. My family\u2019s doctors all participate in its extensive network. According to its guidelines, membership \u201cis based on a religious tradition of mutual aid, neighborly assistance and burden sharing.\u201d Sounds promising. Membership, Altrua\u2019s brochure continues, \u201cis specifically tailored for individuals who maintain a healthy lifestyle, make responsible choices in regards to health and care, and believe in helping others.\u201d I bike, hike and practice yoga; I\u2019m a longtime vegetarian; I\u2019ve never smoked. And who doesn\u2019t believe in helping others? Here\u2019s the catch. In order to join, you have to agree to a \u201cstatement of standards.\u201d Among the list of seven principles are these three: \u201cAccording to the Word of God, sexual relations outside the bond of marriage is morally wrong.\u201d \u201cMarriage is a bond between a man and woman only.\u201d \u201cAbortion is wrong, except in a life-threatening situation to the mother.\u201d I disagree with each of these. And the last I checked, premarital sex, same-sex marriage and abortion were legal in the United States. Still, I considered consenting to the \u201cstandards\u201d for the sake of my family\u2019s financial situation. Imagine if we could put money away for college tuition, or pay down our credit card debt, instead of sending thousands to a giant corporation. What if I swallowed my principles and sent a contribution to Planned Parenthood as penance? Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in the end, I simply couldn\u2019t do it. Much like many of these ministries\u2019 members, I believe certain principles are sacred. (Altrua won\u2019t pay maternity benefits if the pregnancy arose through \u201cadultery or fornication by the member.\u201d) For those on the religious right, their beliefs grant them exemption from federal law, and access to decent affordable health care. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no such loophole for clean-living, charitable nonbelievers.

I will have to part ways with the O.B. practice whose doctors saw me through a complicated pregnancy and delivered my son healthy. Because I hold one set of beliefs about right and wrong, I am subject to federal law. If I subscribed to a different set of morals, I would be exempt from its clutches. Roughly 625,000 people belonged to health sharing ministries as of September; that number is sure to rise as people like me balk at their diminishing options. As Republicans grapple with the Affordable Care Act, it would be wise for them to keep in mind that, like it or not, America is composed of people with different backgrounds, ethnicities and beliefs. The answer is not to repeal the law, which could result in more than 23 million Americans losing their coverage. The answer is to find solutions that allow all working families to find affordable health care that doesn\u2019t demand choosing between their ethics and their ability to provide for their children.",

In the more than three decades I\u2019ve been in Washington, there have by my count been 136 various press correspondents\u2019 dinners. I\u2019ve been to one. And I might hold the record for spending as little time at fund-raisers as possible; I am usually in and out of the door in 10 minutes or less. One thing we fought for that\u2019s worth defending is a fairer, more open and more productive Senate. We changed the Senate rules to guarantee a president\u2019s nominees a simple-majority vote, and declared that a president\u2019s nominees should not be stymied with procedural hurdles and a requirement for supermajority votes. (Supreme Court nominations still have this requirement.) We declared that the changes should apply regardless of which party was in the White House, because fair votes are what democracy is all about. I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump\u2019s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump. Moreover, the rule change has been a victory for those who want to see a functioning, open and transparent Senate. It allowed Mr. Obama\u2019s judicial nominees to receive the just consideration they deserved. Without the rule change, Republicans would have been able to hold open three seats on our nation\u2019s second highest court, the District of Columbia Circuit Court, until the next Republican administration. The judges we confirmed to those seats will loom large in the years to come. In 2014 alone, the Senate confirmed 89 Circuit and District Court judges, more than for any year in two decades. The rule change was consistent with the history of the Senate, which has continually evolved when faced with new challenges. Historically, the only way to reject nominees to cabinet posts, which are not lifetime appointments, has been by a simple-majority vote. Moreover, the supermajority threshold for bills and nominations is not in the Constitution, nor was it in the original Senate rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story From George Washington to George W. Bush, only 68 presidential nominees had been filibustered. Senate Republicans took obstruction to a new level, filibustering 79 of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees in just four years. By removing such procedural ploys, the rule change puts the debate over nominees out in the open. Senators have to answer a simple question: Should a nominee be confirmed, or not? Nominees are now guaranteed a floor vote. With Republicans holding a slim majority, Democrats have a fighting chance at winning every debate. To be sure, persuading a majority of the Senate to your side is harder than blocking a confirmation on a procedural vote. But it is also fairer. When Democrats pick their fights next year, they can do so knowing that, win or lose, they will be debating in a Senate that we made more open and more transparent. If Democrats stand for what they believe in, they will find that trusting the courage of their convictions while out of power will empower them to accomplish great things when the pendulum swings back, as it always does.",

Contraception In Congress, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Price and Mr. Pompeo all voted against requiring employers to provide health care plans that included contraception, citing religious liberty. In an exchange that went viral in 2012, Mr. Price scoffed at the notion that any woman could not afford contraception as part of his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which requires contraceptive coverage without co-payments as well as a range of other preventive services for women. \u201cBring me one woman who has been left behind,\u201d he said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cBring me one. There\u2019s not one.\u201d As numerous women\u2019s advocacy groups have demonstrated, high co-payments for birth control have been a significant deterrent for many women. Medicare and Medicaid Mr. Price proposes offering states lump sums, known as block grants, for Medicaid. These measures could disproportionately hurt women, particularly poor and minority women, since they would end up reducing the amount of federal money going to the states for health care. Medicaid is the main source of health care for low-income women, providing prenatal and maternity care as well as paying for nursing home care, which affects women more because they live longer. Under Obamacare, federal money to expand Medicaid has helped to narrow a longstanding gap in health care between blacks and whites. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Price has also proposed that the federal government provide a contribution that could be applied to private insurance or Medicare. Some fear those changes would hurt women because they become sicker as they age and would be more likely to exceed a fixed federal contribution. \u201cThey will frame this as flexibility, but it\u2019s about the federal government paying less or making it easier for states to cut back on services,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. Child Care and paid maternity leave One of the few bright spots that women\u2019s advocates see in a Trump administration are proposals championed by Ivanka Trump to require paid maternity leave and offer expanded tax credits for child care. The law now provides only for unpaid leave. Many people working on this issue would prefer paid family leave, to allow men to play a larger role in child rearing.

They\u2019re alarmed by Trump, and frequently aghast at him, but they want enough peace to steer him in the directions they desire and to minimize the damage over all.

So they\u2019re trying to stick close enough to whisper, and one of the main stories of the Trump presidency, unless it goes completely off the rails, will be their ceaseless calculations about when they can afford to stay mum and when they can\u2019t. But they can\u2019t afford to stay mum when Trump, merely to stroke his own ego and assert his potency, tells a lie about election results, calling Clinton\u2019s advantage in the popular vote a sham. Certainly Ryan can\u2019t, because he\u2019s a role model and because this lie epitomizes Trump\u2019s demagogic tendencies and legitimizes fake news, the dark consequences of which are becoming ever clearer. The disregard for truth \u2014 and indulgence of fantasy \u2014 among people at the pinnacle of power right now is chilling. Beyond Trump there\u2019s Michael Flynn, his nominee for national security adviser, who has tweeted pure bunk about Clinton\u2019s ties to pedophilia and money laundering. Flynn\u2019s son, who was his chief of staff, perpetuated the whole \u201cpizzagate\u201d madness. And then of course there\u2019s Ben Carson, the housing secretary to be, with his conviction that the pyramids were grain silos. Is Ryan really content to look the other way just for an Obamacare repeal and some tax reform? There\u2019s plenty he can\u2019t count on getting from Trump, who pledged not to monkey with Medicare, which Ryan yearns to change, and is talking about steep tariffs that run counter to Ryan\u2019s philosophy. Ryan has at least hinted about his opposition to those tariffs. But he and other supposedly principled conservatives publicly applauded Trump\u2019s dealings with the air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier, a degree of meddling in the free market that they would have savaged President Obama for.

Last spring he even affirmed his endorsement of Trump while calling him out for racism. Behold leadership at its most gelatinous. Discussing Trump on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he had a manner that was borderline coquettish. He said that Trump, with his tweets, was \u201cbasically giving voice to a lot of people who have felt that they were voiceless.\u201d Sometimes, yes. But many times, Trump is giving a green light to kooks and the finger to the dignity that Americans rightly expect of a president and that Ryan should demand of him. Ryan is sacrificing too much for too little, and it\u2019s time he rummaged through his wobbly endoskeleton and made fresh acquaintance with his spine. Until that happens, this sadly groveling Boy Scout will be lost in the woods.",

Ever since, Republicans have promised to repeal the law as soon as they had a chance, replacing it with something much better. Strange to say, however, they have never described what their replacement would look like. And I don\u2019t mean that they haven\u2019t spelled out all the details. Almost seven years after Obamacare was enacted, Republicans haven\u2019t offered even the broad outline of a health reform plan. Why not?

While many Americans say they disapprove of Obamacare, large majorities approve of the things the Affordable Care Act does, notably ensuring that people with pre-existing medical conditions can still buy insurance. And there\u2019s no way to achieve these things without either a major expansion of government health programs \u2014 hardly a Republican priority \u2014 or something very much like the law Democrats passed. Worse yet, from the Republican point of view, Obamacare has worked. It\u2019s not perfect, by a long shot, but the number of uninsured Americans has plummeted to its lowest level in history. And Americans newly insured thanks to Obamacare are highly satisfied with their coverage. So what can the G.O.P. offer as an alternative? We know what Republicans want: a free-for-all in which insurance companies can discriminate as they like, with minimal regulation and drastic cuts in government aid. Going there would, however, cause millions of Americans \u2014 many of them people who voted for Trump, believing that their recent gains were safe \u2014 to lose coverage. The political blowback would be terrible. Yet failing to repeal Obamacare would also bring heavy political costs. So the emerging Republican health care strategy, according to news reports, is \u201crepeal and delay\u201d \u2014 vote to kill Obamacare, but with the effective date pushed back until after the 2018 midterm elections. By then, G.O.P. leaders promise, they\u2019ll have come up with the replacement they haven\u2019t been able to devise over the past seven years. There will, of course, be no replacement. And there\u2019s likely to be chaos in health care markets well before Obamacare\u2019s official expiration date, as insurance companies exit markets they know will soon collapse. But the political thinking seems to be that they can find a way to blame Democrats for the debacle. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It\u2019s all very Trumpian, if you think about it. An honest memoir of the president-elect\u2019s business career would be titled \u201cThe art of the scam.\u201d After all, his hallmark has been turning a profit on failed business projects, because he finds a way to leave other people holding the bag. In this case, the effort to replace Obamacare will clearly fail miserably in terms of serving the American people, perhaps especially the white working-class voters who backed Mr. Trump. But it could nonetheless be a political success if the public can be convinced to blame the wrong people. You might think that this would be impossible, given the obviousness of the ploy. But given what we\u2019ve seen so far, you have to take seriously the possibility that they\u2019ll get away with it.",

Liberals have their own activist workshops and reading groups, but these rarely instruct students in an intellectual tradition, a centuries-long canon of political philosophy. Why have philosophical summer schools become a vibrant subculture on the right, but only a feeble presence on the left? The disparity underscores a divide between conservatives and liberals over the best way to teach young people \u2014 and, among liberals, a certain squeamishness about the history of ideas. Liberals, however, can\u2019t afford to dismiss Great Books as tools of white supremacy, or to disdain ideological training as the sort of unsavory thing that only conservatives and communists do. These are powerful tools for preparing the next generation of activists to succeed in the bewildering ideological landscape of the country that just elected Mr. Trump. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since Brittany Corona graduated from Colorado Christian University in 2012, she has enrolled in several conservative study programs \u2014 the John Jay Institute\u2019s Fellows Program, the Claremont Institute\u2019s Publius Fellowship and the Young Conservatives Coalition Fellowship \u2014 and has attended conferences hosted by the Liberty Fund. All helped her see that \u201cyou can engage with the left in an academic way, to understand the roots of philosophical differences,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo much of the problem with Fox and MSNBC is that everyone is talking past each other, and they don\u2019t understand their own philosophical positions.\u201d At the John Jay Institute\u2019s semester-long residential program, Ms. Corona lived with other fellows in a mansion outside Philadelphia, wrote papers every night, and wore a black academic robe to class (something the institute no longer requires). Fellows hosted dinners and teas for visiting scholars, politicians and businessmen. \u201cThe idea is that there is a way to restore mores and culture, how you comport yourself and offer hospitality and community,\u201d she said. The appeal here is aesthetic and psychological, not just intellectual. This is an embellished re-creation of college life before the rise of the modern university in the mid-19th century \u2014 presumably without the fines for swearing or playing cards, student duels or frequent riots over inedible dining-hall food. While other programs are not so all-consuming, they, too, whisk participants away from the dozing herds that fill university lecture halls and seat them at seminar tables with scholars and politicians. Most are free; some even come with a stipend. Acceptance means joining an elite vanguard, what the American Enterprise Institute calls \u201cthe next generation of leaders\u201d or \u201ca selective group of promising young conservatives,\u201d as the Claremont Institute puts it. These are safe spaces for conservatives who think little has changed since William F. Buckley scorned the \u201cne plus ultra relativism, idiot nihilism\u201d and \u201choax of academic freedom\u201d at Yale in the 1950s. Participants pride themselves on civil disagreement \u2014 which is easy when there are rarely any liberals in the room. Instead of mocking conservatives\u2019 ideological echo chambers and self-regarding fantasies, progressives should learn from them. For one thing, higher education should include a bit of self-regarding fantasy. It allows 20-year-olds to turn off their phones, try on the ideas of civilization\u2019s greatest minds, and practice interacting as adults. (Academic gowns aren\u2019t such a silly idea, either: They are a great equalizer. One may be a prince or a pauper underneath.) At many universities, those \u201cliberal professors\u201d \u2014 whose nefarious influence these programs claim to counteract \u2014 hardly have time to indoctrinate unsuspecting undergraduates. They\u2019re too busy taking attendance in class, policing students\u2019 use of digital toys and fending off complaints about next week\u2019s outrageous assignment: a book (yes, read the whole thing!). We are witnessing the gradual high schoolization of the university. These conservative seminars make an enormous impact simply by taking students seriously. \u201cThey\u2019re not at the children\u2019s table,\u201d said Tom Palmer, who directs Cato University, a program that mixes undergraduates with midcareer professionals and retirees. \u201cNo one pinches their cheeks and tells them how cute they are.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is another insight here: the power of teaching the canon. Most of these programs conceive of the canon far too narrowly, but the canon is an elite debating society that anyone can join. It shows students that the struggle for freedom and justice began long before the 1960s, and that this deep history lurks beneath today\u2019s policy debates. Unfortunately, at most universities, studying political philosophy has become a form of countercultural rebellion, a discipline marginalized by courses in supposedly practical subjects like business and communications. Campus activists may learn organizing strategies and the argot of identity politics, but few study the history of their own ideas. A few years ago John Halpin, a fellow at the Center for American Progress, started the Progressive Studies Program. His reading list ran from early Progressive reformers to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Port Huron Statement on to President Obama\u2019s Nobel acceptance speech. But he could afford to bring students together for only a day or two. Soon his resources dried up altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get long-term funding for ideological training of this sort\u201d from liberal donors, he told me. \u201cWe get a lot more support for demographic work.\u201d It\u2019s not just the reek of dead white men that puts them off. In the spirit of the New Deal and the Great Society, many progressives think of themselves as empiricists, experimenters who follow the evidence wherever it leads. The left is \u201canti-philosophical, not as committed to the application of deductive philosophical ideas,\u201d Mr. Halpin said. \u201cIf you look at the history of populism, progressivism and the New Deal, you see this level of experimentation and the social science mentality that denies there are foundations.\u201d Yet for all its relativism and wonkishness, the progressive tradition grew from firm ideological commitments: a faith in human equality and empathy; the rule of law; the scientific method. Progressives can find kindred spirits among classic conservative thinkers: Adam Smith on moral sentiments, Edmund Burke\u2019s critique of imperial power. You can\u2019t fully understand the theology of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. without grasping Augustine\u2019s doctrine of original sin. But few young progressives read these authors. The hyperspecialized, careerist ethos of mainstream universities has served them just as poorly as it has conservatives. If the Trump administration does what Mr. Trump has promised to do, it will smash conservative orthodoxies like free trade and the evils of government spending. It will embrace primitive nationalism over humanitarian ethics. Its enemies, conservative and liberal, will find themselves having to make principled cases for positions they thought were settled long ago. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Mr. Halpin said. \u201cLarge numbers of Americans don\u2019t buy the underpinnings of the two major parties right now.\u201d The paradox of the anti-ideological election of 2016 is that ideology is now more important than ever.",

You can see why by looking at Census data from 2013 to 2015, which show the impact of the full implementation of Obamacare. Over that period, the number of uninsured Americans dropped by 13 million; whites without a college degree, who voted Trump by around two to one, accounted for about eight million of that decline. So we\u2019re probably looking at more than five million Trump supporters, many of whom have chronic health problems and recently got health insurance for the first time, who just voted to make their lives nastier, more brutish, and shorter. Why did they do it? They may not have realized that their coverage was at stake \u2014 over the course of the campaign, the news media barely covered policy at all. Or they may have believed Mr. Trump\u2019s assurances that he would replace Obamacare with something great.

Either way, they\u2019re about to receive a rude awakening, which will get even worse once Republicans push ahead with their plans to end Medicare as we know it, which seem to be on even though the president-elect had promised specifically that he would do no such thing. And just in case you\u2019re wondering, no, Mr. Trump can\u2019t bring back the manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the past few decades. Those jobs were lost mainly to technological change, not imports, and they aren\u2019t coming back. There will be nothing to offset the harm workers suffer when Republicans rip up the safety net. Will there be a political backlash, a surge of buyer\u2019s remorse? Maybe. Certainly Democrats will be well advised to hammer Mr. Trump\u2019s betrayal of the working class nonstop. But we do need to consider the tactics that he will use to obscure the scope of his betrayal. One tactic, which we\u2019ve already seen with this week\u2019s ostentatious announcement of a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in America, will be to distract the nation with bright, shiny, trivial objects. True, this tactic will work only if news coverage is both gullible and innumerate. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t \u201cstand up\u201d to Carrier \u2014 he seems to have offered it a bribe. And we\u2019re talking about a thousand jobs in a huge economy; at the rate of one Carrier-size deal a week, it would take Mr. Trump 30 years to save as many jobs as President Obama did with the auto bailout; it would take him a century to make up for the overall loss of manufacturing jobs just since 2000. But judging from the coverage of the deal so far, assuming that the news media will be gullible and innumerate seems like a good bet. And if and when the reality that workers are losing ground starts to sink in, I worry that the Trumpists will do what authoritarian governments often do to change the subject away from poor performance: go find an enemy. Remember what I said about Trump Twitter. Even as he took a big step toward taking health insurance away from millions, Mr. Trump started ranting about taking citizenship away from flag-burners. This was not a coincidence. The point is to keep your eye on what\u2019s important. Millions of Americans have just been sucker-punched. They just don\u2019t know it yet.",

He won the presidency by trashing both political parties. He defied Republican orthodoxy and praised government programs. He memorably dismissed his primary opponents as \u201clow-energy\u201d Jeb, Lyin\u2019 Ted and Little Marco. Doing so allowed him to win a landslide of white working-class voters frustrated with their own lives, the country\u2019s direction and both parties. These voters, by no means libertarians, saw Trump as flawed yet willing to fight for them. Now that he\u2019s won, he has to decide whether his differences with the Republican establishment are more stylistic than substantive. On the issues with the biggest impact on working-class lives, he will need to choose between pursuing the policies of a traditional Republican president and creating something new. In effect, he\u2019ll have to decide whether he is going to be his own president or a bigger version of Little Marco. So far, some kind of standard Republicanism looks more likely. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy policy detail and may defer to Congress. His tax plan is classic trickle-down economics, with a modest middle-class tax cut that would probably lift growth temporarily. His early appointments are mixed, variously nodding to the party establishment, wealthy businesspeople and white nationalists. They offer little indication of a conservative, working-class agenda to match his rhetoric. Yet there are still two reasons to wonder if he will take steps away from traditional Republican economics.

Moore recently told congressional Republicans that, as The Hill phrased it, they \u201cshould no longer think of themselves as belonging to the conservative party of Ronald Reagan,\u201d but instead \u201cto Trump\u2019s populist working-class party.\u201d That party, Moore explained, would need new positions on trade, immigration and infrastructure.

I\u2019m skeptical that these ideas would do more good than, say, the Obama economic proposals that Congress has refused to pass. But the reformist conservative agenda is a vastly more serious attempt to address working-class stagnation than another trickle-down tax cut. Reihan Salam of National Review has called for sharply reducing low-skilled legal immigration (and increasing high-skilled immigration) to reduce the competition for working-class jobs. Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, advocates an overhaul of Obamacare that doesn\u2019t require throwing millions of people off of health insurance. Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute is full of ideas to encourage work: less occupational licensing, a lower payroll tax, more apprenticeships, a disability system that no longer incentivizes idleness. These proposals try to use a market-based philosophy to help working-class families \u2014 which is quite different from the recent Republican emphasis on comforting the comfortable. Presidents may not be able to directly control the economy\u2019s growth rate, but they do have enormous influence on which groups benefit most from government policy. For now, these issues remain obscured by Trump\u2019s fondness for sideshows and his sordid promotion of the family business. Those distractions won\u2019t disappear when he becomes president. No doubt, he\u2019ll often describe his policies however he feels like describing them.

Leo Gerard, the steelworkers\u2019 president, sent a letter to his union\u2019s 600,000 members, acknowledging that its ranks \u201cwere divided this election season.\u201d While the economy has grown, he wrote, \u201cthe growth has failed to stimulate the manufacturing sector because of our nation\u2019s failed trade policies.\u201d Maintaining that Mr. Trump had appropriated his union\u2019s message, he wrote, \u201cTrump used our own words to speak to these problems, and to the real suffering, fears and anxieties that so many feel.\u201d Most labor leaders viewed Mr. Trump far more harshly than his union backers did; they often attacked him as a con artist and a threat to unions and workers. Mrs. Clinton would have prevailed had she adopted a more muscular pro-worker message, union leaders lament, more like Bernie Sanders\u2019s message attacking trade deals and inequality. With Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and with Republicans now controlling both houses of Congress, unions are expecting a series of stinging blows. Even as Mr. Trump talks of spending $1 trillion to improve infrastructure, many Republicans are eager to repeal an 85-year-old law requiring that contractors pay union-level wages on federal projects. Congressional Republicans are likely to take up nationwide \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation, which would sap union treasuries by barring any requirement that workers pay union dues or fees. And even if Senate Democrats manage to block such a law, Republican gains in Kentucky and Missouri mean those states are likely to enact their own right-to-work laws. Mr. Trump will most likely scrap most of Mr. Obama\u2019s executive orders on labor, including ones requiring federal contractors to disclose labor law violations, provide paid sick leave and pay a $10.10 minimum wage. He may also erase a regulation that lets four million additional workers qualify for overtime pay. (Last Tuesday, a federal judge in Texas suspended that regulation.) And the National Labor Relations Board under Mr. Trump will no doubt overturn numerous union-friendly moves by the Obama board, among them ones speeding up unionization elections and giving graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities the right to unionize. Whoever Mr. Trump names to the Supreme Court to fill Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat will help to re-establish a conservative majority, boding ill for labor. In a closely watched case, a California public-school teacher asked the court to rule that any requirement that she pay union fees violated her First Amendment freedom of speech. Last March, the court deadlocked, 4-4, in that case, but with a Trump appointee the court will probably rule that government employees can\u2019t be required to pay any fees to support the union that represents them. That would be a sharp blow to the nation\u2019s public-employee unions and their treasuries. Just 11.1 percent of American workers belong to unions, half the level when Ronald Reagan became president and down from 35 percent in the 1950s. However, businesses and Republicans remain wary of labor\u2019s power. \u201cUnions are a small minority of the work force, but they still have a strong war chest that can be used for political purposes,\u201d said Randel K. Johnson, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce.

Hacker, a political-science professor at Yale, said the shrunken movement, which represents just 6.7 percent of private-sector workers, faces \u201can existential crisis.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an irony here,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions are probably the most consistent voice for the broad middle class of any organization today, yet the voice of the middle class was seen as an important part of Donald Trump\u2019s victory. The further decline of labor is going to hurt many members of the middle class.\u201d Unions are brainstorming how to weather a Trump presidency. Some will no doubt work with Mr. Trump on rebuilding infrastructure and overhauling trade agreements, while other unions will do battle with him \u2014 on his plans to repeal Obamacare, deport millions of immigrants and much more.

Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said that with progressive groups on the defensive, unions would team up increasingly with embattled women\u2019s, environmental and immigrant groups. She said unions needed to continue fighting, no matter who was president. \u201cOur strong belief is collective action is the way for us to win wage increases and create good jobs,\u201d she said. With the climate in Washington becoming more hostile to unions, worker advocates might focus on more winnable local battles, having just won statewide referendums to raise the minimum wage to $12 in Arizona, Colorado and Maine and $13.50 in Washington. And with traditional unions in the Republican line of fire, there will be newfangled efforts to lift wages and working conditions, like a nonunion drivers guild for thousands of Uber drivers in New York. Another innovative effort, the Fight for 15, is planning protests in 340 cities on Tuesday to try to win a $15 wage for everyone from McDonald\u2019s workers to airport baggage handlers. As unions grow weaker, many workers will inevitably continue to search for new ways to band together to make their voices heard.",

Leaders of both parties missed middle-class voters\u2019 determination this year to blow up a political establishment that had failed to improve their lives, the \u201cprimal scream on the part of a lot of voters who are disenchanted with the status quo,\u201d in the words of David Axelrod, an architect of President Obama\u2019s 2008 call for change. That scream emanated early on from passionate supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019s calls for revolution, against which Hillary Clinton, for all her experience (indeed, in part because of it), seemed an emblem of the status quo. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular vote totals surpass Donald Trump\u2019s by more than two million and counting \u2014 an edge not seen in an Electoral College loss since 1876. But her fate was sealed in industrial and rural battlegrounds, chiefly Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Ohio, majority-white states whose 70 electoral votes President Obama won in 2012. Sexism and racial bigotry obviously played roles in her defeat. But far greater problems were her strategists\u2019 bet that a coalition of minority voters and white Democratic stalwarts would deliver a landslide and her failure to crystallize a broad economic vision from among her many proposals for helping working-class voters regardless of race \u2014 the kind of message Mr. Obama was able to send. Her characterization of a swath of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d didn\u2019t help. To avert a future of increasingly factional politics, the United States needs at least one major party with a message that transcends the boundaries of race and class. Mr. Trump says he intends to govern for all Americans, and he will have his chance to prove a commitment to helping more than just the electorate that supported him, which was overwhelmingly white. Democrats are now in search of their own unifying message, as they sort through the wreckage of 2016. \u201cThe party started looking at people through interest group coalitions, and we thought, \u2018If we talk to them all in different ways, that will be enough to cobble together an election coalition,\u2019 \u201d Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona says. \u201cBut I think there is a common interest in our economic policies between the laid-off white worker in Flint, the African-American and the Latino in Phoenix.\u201d Despite personal revulsion at Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on immigration, Islam and refugees, prominent Democrats have said he deserves a chance. President Obama, for one, has said: \u201cI want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance.\u201d But he has also made clear he will not yield on \u201ccore questions about our values and our ideals.\u201d Negotiating in this spirit could help Democrats shape Mr. Trump\u2019s amorphous ideas into useful legislation. If he resists, he\u2019ll supply Democrats with an argument to take to the heartland, as well as the coasts, and claim the loyalty of Americans who deserve hope, regardless of race.",

The man who spent years saying \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d is now saying \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d to all sorts of people, though it\u2019s not at all clear whether his choices result from a carefully thought-out strategy or are being made on the fly. The latest winners in the Trump job fair are Gov. Nikki Haley, Betsy DeVos and, by all accounts, Ben Carson, who is likely to be named soon. Anyone seeking a clear policy or ideological pattern here will be disappointed. Ms. Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, is a popular South Carolina governor with a winning manner and zero foreign policy experience. Mr. Carson, who is expected to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is a famed neurosurgeon who was demolished by Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries and whose only experience with housing appears to be that he is a homeowner. Ms. DeVos, the prospective education secretary, is a wealthy Republican donor who leads the advocacy group American Federation for Children, but who spent a considerable amount of time on Wednesday insisting that she does not support Common Core, which Mr. Trump bashed on the campaign trail. There is no perfect prescription for assembling a cabinet, although most incoming presidents have aimed for geographical balance and, in recent years, gender and racial diversity. Nor is there any particular order in which cabinet members are supposed to be named, although here, again, presidents-elect have sought to nail down top foreign policy and defense jobs fairly soon. On that score, Mr. Trump is only partly there, with Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Representative Mike Pompeo as director of central intelligence, but no secretary of state or defense as yet.

Both are hard-liners, as is true of the hard-right Stephen Bannon, whom Mr. Trump appointed as his chief strategist. Reince Priebus, the new chief of staff, seems more of a consensus pick, since his main job over the last few years, as chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been to keep as many Republicans as possible as happy as possible.

After all, Mr. Trump has been tinkering with his stances on Obamacare, climate change, so-called enhanced interrogation and immigration, and often seems to express the views of the last person he\u2019s spoken to.",

It seems like the first thing to do is really learn what this election is teaching us. Second, this seems like a moment for some low-passion wonkery. It\u2019s stupid to react to every Trump tweet outrage with your own predictable howls. It\u2019s silly to treat politics and governance purely on cultural grounds, as a high school popularity contest, where my sort of people denigrates your sort of people. We\u2019ve arrived at the moment of actual governing. We\u2019ve arrived at the moment when Trump has to turn his vague notions into concrete proposals. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump promised to rip up the Iran deal, but he seems to be realizing there are six other signatories and we\u2019ve lost leverage with the Iranians because we already gave them back their money. Trump promises to repeal Obamacare, but how do you do that when it has already been woven into the fabric of every health care system in America? Whether it\u2019s reforming immigration or trade policy, his governing challenge is going to be astoundingly hard and complicated. Surely this is not the moment to get swept up in our own moral superiority, but rather to understand the specificity of the proposals he comes up with and to offer concrete amendments and alternatives to address the same problems. Finally, surely a little universal humility is in order. Orthodox Republicans spent the last 30 years talking grandly about entrepreneurialism while the social fabric around their core voters disintegrated. Maybe a little government action would have helped? The Democratic Party is losing badly on the local, state and national levels. If you were a football team you\u2019d be 2-8. Maybe you can do better than responding with the sentiment: Sadly, the country isn\u2019t good enough for us. Those of us in the opinion class have been complaining that Trump voters are post-truth, that they don\u2019t have a respect for expertise. Well, the experts created a school system that doesn\u2019t produce skilled graduates. The experts designed Obamacare exchanges that are failing. Maybe those of us in the professional class need to win back some credibility the old-fashioned way, with effective reform. There will be plenty of time to be disgusted with Trump\u2019s bigotry, narcissism and incompetence. It\u2019s tempting to get so caught up in his outrage du jour that you never have to do any self-examination. But let\u2019s be honest: It wouldn\u2019t kill us Trump critics to take a break from our never-ending umbrage to engage in a little listening.",

        "parsed_article": "Now Democrats are out of power, and his major policies are on the chopping block. The health care exchanges and the individual insurance mandate might be legislated out of existence. Mr. Trump is planning to jettison the Paris climate change agreement as well as the Iran nuclear deal. Young immigrants will no longer be protected from deportation. Republicans could use the Congressional Review Act to knock down dozens of rules that were put in place since May, ranging from regulations guaranteeing paid sick leave to people working under federal contracts to consumer protections like the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s prohibition on selling antibacterial soaps. There won\u2019t be enough votes to move forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster on foreign policy threatens to reverse the notable improvement in diplomatic relations that took place under Mr. Obama. The Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to enforce civil rights laws and reform policing will die the slow death of regulatory neglect. The balance of power in the Supreme Court will shift back to the right. And policies are not the only things at risk. Republicans have attacked a basic set of ideas that Mr. Obama tried to promote. With Stephen K. Bannon, someone who has long appealed to anti-Semites and the \u201calt-right,\u201d serving as the president-elect\u2019s chief strategist, Mr. Trump will double down on his attacks against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and social values like ethnic pluralism and gender equality. Yet with all of this wreckage looming on the horizon, there is a glimmer of hope that some of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy can be salvaged. In American history, there have been a number of elections that seemed to be a repudiation of the previous president, including those of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama himself in 2008. But these did not produce the full-scale reversal of programs that some observers expected. The reason is what political scientists call the process of \u201cpolicy feedback.\u201d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once new policies are put in place, they can generate strong constituencies that will defend them from attack. \u201cWith those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program,\u201d boasted Roosevelt, anticipating the dynamics that would make elderly entitlements a third rail in American politics. Voters come to depend on benefits, politicians are expected to protect them, and interest groups emerge that have a stake in their continuation. When this happens, a president\u2019s contributions can outlast the political coalition that created them. Eisenhower left most of the New Deal alone. The Great Society survived the Reagan Revolution. And Mr. Obama failed to wipe away George W. Bush\u2019s counterterrorism program. Mr. Trump will encounter strong resistance to revoking the Medicaid coverage that 12 million Americans now enjoy under Obamacare. Numerous Republican governors, including the future vice president, Mike Pence, pushed for the expansion of the rolls. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s own supporters probably like the benefits they have received from the A.C.A., even if they don\u2019t realize it. Even Dodd-Frank, hardly popular on Wall Street, could survive now that firms have adjusted to deal with the new rules. With only a narrow majority in the Senate, the G.O.P. will contend with constant obstruction as it tries to gut Mr. Obama\u2019s programs. On foreign policy, Mr. Trump\u2019s tone is far from Mr. Obama\u2019s cool demeanor. And yet he is unlikely to pull out of NATO, and his push to pressure European states into contributing more to their collective defense actually builds on statements that Mr. Obama had been making. Mr. Trump is likely to find strong pushback from Congress and the public, as well as pivotal allies overseas, against any substantial change in a post-Iraq world where support for large-scale war remains thin and when we need allies to combat the threat posed by the Islamic State.

The Obama years helped inspire new social activism, from Black Lives Matter to the Bernie Sanders campaign, that will remain a powerful force within the Democratic coalition. And the nation has shown that there is much deeper support for values like ethnic pluralism than Mr. Trump\u2019s election suggests. According to a recent poll, 54 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for immigrants already in our borders. Gallup has found that fewer than a third of the Americans it polled thought that imposing a religious test on people who entered the country and barring Muslims would be effective in combating terrorism. Many more, nonetheless, supported Mr. Trump. But it is significant that the candidate running as a defender of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, Hillary Clinton, won over a million more popular votes. Democrats now need to focus on the party-building that Mr. Obama neglected, so that the next time they find themselves in power, they can build on whatever remains of the policies he left behind.",

Your answer may be included in a follow up post. \"Share Your Thoughts\" Go to Facebook Secession has virtually zero chance of success, which is doubtless one reason that retiring Senator Barbara Boxer just introduced an equally hopeless bill to change the Electoral College. But Caleavefornia talk does reflect sincere frustration at being overtaxed and underrepresented in a country that suddenly seems unenthusiastic about our way of life. Californian officials have begun channeling that public mood into bracing us-against-them rhetoric. The Los Angeles chief of police, Charlie Beck, has declared that his officers will take no part in deporting undocumented immigrants. Governor Brown promised to \u201cprotect the precious rights of our people and continue to confront the existential threat of our time \u2014 devastating climate change.\u201d Senator-elect Harris conceded that most Californians are feeling dispirited and said, \u201cYou are not alone, you matter and we\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Then there is the joint statement released on Nov. 9 by the State Senate leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, and Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon: \u201cToday, we woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land, because yesterday Americans expressed their views on a pluralistic and democratic society that are clearly inconsistent with the values of the people of California. We have never been more proud to be Californians. By a margin in the millions, Californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment, bigotry and misogyny.\u201d They went on to call California a refuge of justice and opportunity \u201cfor people of all walks, talks, ages and aspirations \u2014 regardless of how you look, where you live, what language you speak, or who you love,\u201d and promised that, as they put it, \u201cWe will not be dragged back into the past.\u201d This last bit matters because California\u2019s past is not pretty. The genocide of indigenous Californians was remarkable among North American Indian wars for its sheer scale and evil. California resentment of Chinese laborers in the Gold Rush mines and on the railroads helped produce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first federal law to restrict immigration by people of a specific ethnicity. During World War II, Californians incarcerated thousands of law-abiding American citizens of Japanese descent while leaving those of German and Italian descent unmolested. After that war ended, African-American migrants to California were surprised to find racist real-estate redlining and a virulent West Coast version of Jim Crow. Tim Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Los Angeles, told me that his father was sent out here alone from Mississippi at age 13 because a lynch mob was after him. \u201cWhen my father got off a train in L.A., the first thing he saw was a \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign on a restaurant,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cWhen he married my mother, a white woman, he could not marry her here, so their marriage certificate is in espa\u00f1ol because they went down to old Mexico.\u201d The Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped, but not enough to stop the violent Watts uprising of 1965 or the Rodney King riots of 1992, both of which expressed collective fury over systemic racism. As recently as 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, revived a flagging re-election bid by backing Proposition 187, which barred the state from providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Proposition 187 passed, but was never really implemented. According to Senator de Le\u00f3n, Wilson\u2019s re-election did for California what Mr. Trump\u2019s election and promised deportations might yet do for America: It woke up the Latino vote and ushered in the deep-blue politics that have since helped to legalize same-sex marriage, make Obamacare work, turn virtually the entire state into one big sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and enact far-reaching climate-change regulations.

Anyone who doubts that progressivism is good business has to reckon with the fact that California is now the sixth largest economy in the world, ahead of France, Russia and India, with $2.46 trillion in gross domestic product. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It\u2019s not all sunshine, of course. California\u2019s $54 billion agriculture industry thrives on the exploitation of migrant workers, and our poverty rates and income inequality are among the nation\u2019s worst, thanks partly to a technology economy that makes millionaires in coastal cities but does little for the hinterlands except raise the cost of living. That helps explain why 3.7 million Californians \u2014 33 percent of the vote \u2014 chose Donald Trump and why California\u2019s electoral map resembles the national one, with red counties in the rural white interior and blue mostly on the coast. Many Californians are also casting a gimlet eye at the two big industries whose leaders talk a liberal game but sell products that arguably undermine civil society: entertainment and technology. In Los Angeles, that conversation includes movies and TV shows that, in the words of the actor and author Robinne Lee, \u201coften extend the perception that it\u2019s a white man\u2019s world and everyone else is just a guest star.\u201d In Silicon Valley the obvious culprits are Twitter, which has become a hate-speech superhighway, and Facebook and Google, both of which capture eyeballs by tailoring news feeds and search results to make us feel good. In so doing, and especially by supporting the mass dissemination of fake news and outright lies, they radically reinforce the biases that drive Americans into dangerously oppositional camps of red and blue. But the overwhelming \u2014 and novel \u2014 sentiment coming out of Nov. 8 remains one of common identity, which is remarkable in a place that is 38.8 percent Hispanic, 38 percent non-Hispanic white, 14.7 percent Asian and 6.5 percent African-American, and where just about everybody knows both steady churchgoers and at least one loving and stable family with two moms or two dads. Paola Martinez-Montes, director of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment in San Diego, says that California\u2019s African-American and Latino communities no longer see themselves as oppositional and that she has also been in touch with the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand that we are going to walk in this together, and that\u2019s really positive,\u201d she told me. Senator de Le\u00f3n, by the time I caught up with him, was on an airplane bound for a climate-change conference in Morocco. \u201cI\u2019m going to be mobbed \u2014 everybody is going to be asking me what the hell happened,\u201d he said by telephone, just before the plane took off. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t want to go our direction, we\u2019re going it alone.\u201d",

Bush\u2019s attempt to privatize Social Security, in which he claimed a \u201cmandate\u201d from voters despite having run a campaign entirely focused on other issues. That was bad, but this is much worse \u2014 and not just because Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin, making any claim of a mandate bizarre. Have you changed anything in your daily life since the election? For example, have you tried to understand opposing points of view, donated to a group, or contacted your member of Congress? Your answer may be included in a follow up post. \"Share Your Thoughts\" Go to Facebook Candidate Trump ran on exactly the opposite position from the one President-elect Trump seems to be embracing, claiming to be an economic populist defending the (white) working class. Now he\u2019s going to destroy a program that is crucial to that class? Which brings me to the second point: While Medicare is an essential program for a great majority of Americans, it\u2019s especially important for the white working-class voters who supported Mr. Trump most strongly. Partly that\u2019s because Medicare beneficiaries are considerably whiter than the country as a whole, precisely because they\u2019re older and reflect the demography of an earlier era. Beyond that, think of what would happen if Medicare didn\u2019t exist. Some older Americans would probably be able to retain health coverage by staying at jobs that come with such coverage. But this option would by and large be available only to those with extensive education: Labor force participation among seniors is strongly correlated with education, in part because the highly educated are healthier than the less educated, and in part because their jobs require less physical effort. Working-class seniors would be left stranded, unable to get the health care they needed. Still, doesn\u2019t something have to be done about Medicare? No \u2014 which is my third point. People like Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, have often managed to bamboozle the media into believing that their efforts to dismantle Medicare and other programs are driven by valid economic concerns. They aren\u2019t. It has been obvious for a long time that Medicare is actually more efficient than private insurance, mainly because it doesn\u2019t spend large sums on overhead and marketing, and, of course, it needn\u2019t make room for profits.

Obamacare, have been remarkably successful in their efforts to \u201cbend the curve\u201d \u2014 to rein in the long-term rise in Medicare expenses. In fact, since 2010 Medicare outlays per beneficiary have risen only 1.4 percent a year, less than the inflation rate. This success is one main reason long-term budget projections have dramatically improved. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So why try to destroy this successful program, which is in important respects doing better than ever? The main answer, from the point of view of people like Mr. Ryan, is probably that Medicare is in the cross hairs precisely because of its success: It would be very helpful for opponents of government to do away with a program that clearly demonstrates the power of government to improve people\u2019s lives. And there\u2019s an additional benefit to the right from Medicare privatization: It would create a lot of opportunities for private profits, earned by diverting dollars that could have been used to provide health care. In summary, then, privatizing Medicare would betray a central promise of the Trump campaign, would specifically betray the interests of the voter bloc that thought it had found a champion, and would be terrible policy. You might think this would make the whole idea a non-starter. And this push will, in fact, fail \u2014 just like Social Security privatization in 2005 \u2014 if voters realize what\u2019s happening. What\u2019s crucial now is to make sure that voters do, in fact, realize what\u2019s going on. And this isn\u2019t just a job for politicians. It\u2019s also a chance for the news media, which failed so badly during the campaign, to start doing its job.",

But Republican leaders don\u2019t seem too concerned with those people. Instead, they are trying to convince people who don\u2019t rely on the A.C.A. that repeal of the law would leave them better off. Paul Ryan, for instance, said on on Fox News on Thursday, that \u201cbecause of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.\u201d That statement is false. According to the Medicare trustees, cost controls in the A.C.A. are one of the reasons that the system\u2019s hospital trust fund is projected to remain solvent through 2028 \u2014 11 years longer than before the A.C.A. was enacted.

He\u2019s suddenly professing faith in Trump \u2014 or, rather, playing a fascinating mind game in which he endeavors to save his legacy by complimenting Trump into compliance. That was some through-the-looking-glass news conference on Monday, when Obama, who had previously warned that Trump was all four horsemen of the apocalypse rolled into one shocking jockey, spoke of Trump\u2019s \u201cgifts\u201d and how \u201cgregarious\u201d he could be. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is ideological,\u201d Obama said. \u201cUltimately, he is pragmatic.\u201d From your lips, Mr. President, to God\u2019s ear.

(\u201cYou\u2019re the man.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re the man.\u201d) Or that Steve Bannon was en route to the West Wing. Perhaps the Bannon appointment didn\u2019t sink in fully until Tuesday, when Obama, in Greece, had chillier words of warning about the direction in which a Trump administration might \u2014 but mustn\u2019t \u2014 turn. \u201cWe are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism,\u201d he said. That\u2019s hardly the extent of the vigil. Trump is reportedly seeking security clearances for his children, who will be running his business, and a former State Department official watching an increasingly messy transition process took to Twitter to warn other Republicans to \u201cstay away\u201d from Trump\u2019s \u201cangry, arrogant\u201d team. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Obama is partly trying to save face after Hillary Clinton\u2019s devastating loss. In the weeks before the election, he implored Americans: Honor me by choosing her. Not enough of them did, and at Monday\u2019s news conference, he seemed to steal a page from Trump\u2019s playbook and take issue with her stamina. He never said her name but noted, pointedly, how he had trudged through \u201cevery small town and fair and fish fry\u201d in Iowa, a state that he won in 2008 and 2012 and that she, with less trudging, lost. He also repeatedly recited a litany of yardsticks by which he was leaving the country in fantastic fettle. Was he reassuring us \u2014 or himself? From his electrifying address at the 2004 Democratic convention through his stirring 2008 presidential campaign, he spoke of transcending blue and red, uniting black and white, healing. And here we are. It has to gall him. It definitely gives him incentive to use whatever psychological jujitsu necessary to nudge and manipulate Trump. He doesn\u2019t want historians to write that he opened the door to a monster. So he\u2019s pressing for a sunnier tale: the monster defanged, the nation safe and sound. And he\u2019s a patriot, always has been, which is what\u2019s so rich here. Trump bangs on about putting America first, when he really puts himself before all else. That shriveled, unhinged hood ornament of his, Rudy Giuliani, is on the record questioning Obama\u2019s love for America. But Obama loves this country enough to summon the same grace for his successor that other presidents did for theirs, though his is a nasty, juvenile breed apart. And he loves this country enough to try to calm it when it most needs calming, even if that means a willed optimism about Trump that\u2019s oh so difficult to share.",

        "parsed_article": "I think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics. So perhaps that\u2019s a good place to start a conversation about the future. I\u2019ve been amazed, since I came to Washington, at the collective failure to understand that point. It is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history. In 2008, Democrats were popping Champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics. Now they see most of their dreams being unraveled. And Republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable. Gail: Hey, I made a point! Things are looking better already. Arthur: Both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors. The losers err on the side of excessive fatalism, like the classic threats to leave the country. Gail: Reader email has informed me it\u2019s way harder to leave the country than one might think. We Americans aren\u2019t in all that much demand. Arthur: And the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent, they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side. Gail: Well, looking at a President Trump and a Republican-controlled House and Senate, I\u2019d say we are in for a stretch of dumb things. Presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two. President Obama did that with health care. His agenda was nothing compared to George W. Bush, who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the Iraq invasion. But Obamacare was certainly a big lift. It was also a central campaign promise. I know you think it was a bad idea. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Arthur: I think that strategy is enormously shortsighted. I remember thinking when the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress in 2009, \u201cEven though they don\u2019t have to, it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist Republicans into Obamacare. Some day the Republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it.\u201d And sure enough, here we are. My point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology. That\u2019s why he got elected. But I think it is impractical and imprudent to \u2014 forgive me for another reference to \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d \u2014 turn it up to 11. Give on a few things where you don\u2019t have to, because someday you\u2019re going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most. The Trump administration might learn from the outgoing administration\u2019s horror at seeing some or all of Obamacare repealed. Gail: We part company here. My perception of Obamacare was of a Democratic Party willing to work on compromise legislation while the Republicans just stalled. There was no unified Republican position, just a ton of people who wanted to be deal-makers but kept changing their mind. But the bottom line is that we\u2019ve left behind the old let\u2019s-have-a-drink-after-work Congress. We\u2019ve now got guys who sleep in their offices and don\u2019t even talk to the other side at the House gym. Arthur: Secretly a lot of them are actually friends, but I take your point. And that\u2019s another recommendation I would make to President Trump: Make friends everyplace. That was the L.B.J.-Reagan-Clinton magic. Don\u2019t golf with the same people every week. Gail: Since I have no choice, I\u2019m prepared to look on the bright side for a while. The Republican hatred of Obamacare is so great that even if Hillary Clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through Congress. Trump has promised \u201csomething better\u201d \u2014 and as of his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program. So we\u2019ll see what he comes up with. I know you\u2019re a big Paul Ryan fan. His agenda and Trump\u2019s agenda really don\u2019t match, do they? Arthur: Congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years, and Ryan and Trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe. Ryan\u2019s plan includes a health care replacement plan for Obamacare. It will actually do some of the things liberals (and conservatives) really want, like getting more people covered. I realize that it\u2019s very disappointing for progressives to see Obamacare repealed, but it\u2019s not like it will be replaced by nothing. Gail: This is one area where the product doesn\u2019t usually resemble the recipe. I remember presidential candidate Barack Obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public, on C-Span.

Followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Arthur: It\u2019s certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime. Nobody calls his or her congressman and says, \u201cDon\u2019t just do something, sit there!\u201d Gail: Only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining it\u2019s too big. But let\u2019s move on. I\u2019m obviously cranky. Arthur: Really? How come? Gail: Any other postelection mullings? How about the early appointments? The Republican establishment seems super-relieved to have Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff. But Steve Bannon is going to be chief strategist. Which could mean anything. To me Priebus is the kind of guy Democrats should learn to live with \u2014 they lost, and there\u2019s going to be a Republican White House. But Bannon is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the Trump crowd. Who do you think will really have the president\u2019s ear? Arthur: It looks like both will be influential. After watching the campaign, I didn\u2019t find Sunday\u2019s pair of appointments too surprising. They signal that in office, as during his candidacy, Trump will seek to merge traditional Republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism. Gail: And what about immigration? It seems now the wall may be a fence, and the deportees will be only criminals. Barack Obama has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years. Don\u2019t see where the big switch is. Arthur: I think that\u2019s right, given what we\u2019ve heard so far. In that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and fence, and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. Those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the source of Trump\u2019s strength \u2014 rural areas and declining small cities. Haven\u2019t you always told me that one of our problems is that Americans have stopped moving to where the jobs are? Apparently you\u2019re right and they\u2019d prefer to stay put, be angry and elect Donald Trump president. Arthur: That\u2019s one interpretation. Another is that people simply don\u2019t have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a move, especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills. So they stay put. I find this the more compelling view. Gail: I always prefer the explanation that doesn\u2019t just boil down to: \u201cGet a move on, lazy.\u201d Arthur: I have three teenagers, so I confess to using that approach sometimes. As to how all this affected politics, my colleague Nick Eberstadt published a wonderful book earlier this year called \u201cMen Without Work.\u201d It shows the collapse of employment among working-class middle-aged men over the past 50 years. This got much worse in the wake of the Great Recession and the disappointing \u201crecovery,\u201d most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution. In other words, the Obama administration\u2019s economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population. Gail: Important point, which I plan to reiterate regularly when Trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks. Arthur: The problem isn\u2019t just material hardship, especially given the expansion of welfare benefits. It\u2019s the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work. For years, neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education. There\u2019s an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural America. Gail: I think we\u2019re all pretty clear today that there\u2019s a cry of rage from non-college-educated white Americans. And Trump was pretty good on the rage-cry end. But beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan \u2014 which Clinton was actually clearer on \u2014 I haven\u2019t heard a whole lot of Trumpian solutions. Arthur: When Trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling Nafta, experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals. But I talked to tons of people supporting Trump who basically said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that stuff will work. But finally there\u2019s a guy who at least is saying he\u2019ll try something to bring back jobs.\u201d Finally, someone who cared about them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: The bottom line was change versus no change. That\u2019s almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and I am sorry to say that Hillary Clinton was the no-change candidate. All she promised was more of the Obama administration plus that infrastructure repair. It made sense in many ways. The country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under Obama. But if you\u2019re not a happy camper, nobody\u2019s going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate. Arthur: I know this election is really hard for progressives to swallow, but there\u2019s a way to understand it, at least in part. A few years ago I was having lunch with Neera Tanden, who is president of the Center for American Progress (conservative and liberal think tank presidents are secretly friends, too). I asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved President Obama so much. She said, \u201cHe gives them dignity.\u201d I thought that was very profound, and I think that\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s going on today as well with Trump. Gail: I like your analysis, as far as the voters\u2019 emotions goes. As to Trump\u2019s ability to follow through \u2014 well, we\u2019ll see how it works out. Especially if the new administration\u2019s first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks. Arthur: I just laughed out loud about that one. Gail: But the holidays are coming, Arthur, and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24-7 politics. That\u2019s why God invented football. Arthur: Obviously we share the same basic theology. Gail: We\u2019ll be taking a conversational break, too. But while I\u2019m being thankful on Thanksgiving, I\u2019ll be counting our talks as one of my blessings. Arthur: Me too, Gail. Happy Thanksgiving.",

        "parsed_article": "To understand why, let\u2019s go back to the world of individual insurance before the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. In that world, the primary source of profit for insurers was not providing better care so that patients stayed healthy, or negotiating better prices with hospitals and drug companies; it was their ability to avoid the sick and insure only the healthy. And insurers had three tools for doing so: denying coverage to the insured for any costs associated with pre-existing conditions; denying insurance entirely to sick people; and charging the sick much higher prices than the healthy, a practice called health underwriting. Advertisement Continue reading the main story If Mr. Trump preserves just the ban on the first of these tools, and allows insurers to reintroduce the other two, he has effectively done nothing. That\u2019s because any insurer can simply use the other tools to accomplish the same goal as it could with all three. Suppose a breast-cancer survivor applied for insurance in Mr. Trump\u2019s post-Obamacare world. It\u2019s true that the insurer could not offer her coverage that didn\u2019t include breast-cancer treatments. But the insurer could simply not sell her coverage at all.

Both would be perfectly legal if the Affordable Care Act was repealed and replaced under Mr. Trump\u2019s principles. If we say that insurers have to pay for breast-cancer treatment for their insured, but allow them to set unaffordable prices or deny insurance altogether, how does that solve the problem? In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s idea would make insurance markets function even worse than they did before Obamacare. Back then, an otherwise-healthy breast-cancer survivor could at least get insurance coverage for medical expenses not related to her cancer. If Mr. Trump followed through with his suggestion, that would not be possible: The insurer would simply deny coverage altogether rather than take the risk of being forced to pay for treatment for a recurring breast cancer. So Mr. Trump would not only continue the insurance discrimination that plagued the country before the Affordable Care Act but even make it worse. In fact, there is simply no Republican replacement for the act that wouldn\u2019t leave millions of Americans at serious financial risk. The single most important accomplishment of the Affordable Care Act was to bring the United States into line with the rest of the developed world, as a place where people were not one bad gene or one bad traffic accident away from bankruptcy. Mr. Trump and other Republicans can discuss kind-sounding alternatives as much as they like, but they can\u2019t hide the fact that repealing the fundamental insurance protections that are central to the act would be a cruel backward step.",

With TrumpWorks hiring, a wall rising (albeit haphazardly) on the southern border and millennials\u2019 entry into the housing market sparking a sudden construction boom, both wages and the work-force participation rate began to sharply climb.

Trump\u2019s supply-side tax cuts passed on a party-line vote, but his infrastructure bill passed with a motley bipartisan coalition.

In return for letting those bills reach the floor, Paul Ryan was promised Trump\u2019s backing for an omnibus health care bill replacing Obamacare and reforming Medicare at once. But as health care negotiations dragged on across 2017, it became clear that Trump was quietly encouraging a tacit right-left grass-roots alliance against benefit cuts of any sort. This came to a head in what was dubbed \u201cthe Battle of Janesville,\u201d when Ryan found himself shouted down by a crowd of town hall seniors, some sporting \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps, as he tried to defend Medicare premium support. After that scene (which played over and over on Sean Hannity\u2019s nightly propaganda hour) Ryan\u2019s vision withered on the legislative vine \u2014 leaving Obamacare to limp on, its subsidies officially repealed but \u201ctemporarily\u201d extended every year. Other right-wing priorities have fared better, especially on energy and financial deregulation, and the Democrats have found some political footing attacking Trump\u2019s coziness with Wall Street. But overall he has afforded them fewer targets than they expected. Somehow Kellyanne Conway, \u201ccounselor to the president\u201d and all-purpose Svengali, has persuaded him to tiptoe around racial politics and simply ignore the constant left-wing protests, which has increased the protests\u2019 fury, but also their unpopularity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Meanwhile his obvious lack of interest in social conservatism has enabled Trump to effectively decentralize the culture wars. His Supreme Court appointments (Mike Lee to fill the Scalia seat, Ted Cruz to replace a retiring Clarence Thomas) have simply kept the court\u2019s Obama-era balance intact; Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer keep taking their vitamins and declining to retire. There have been no nationalizing flash points, no equivalent of Bush\u2019s marriage amendment push or Obama\u2019s mandates on religious institutions; whenever transgender rights come up, Trump\u2019s press secretary, Jeffrey Lord, murmurs \u201cit\u2019s a state issue\u201d and moves on. Finally, in foreign policy, Trump has delivered what he promised: A brutal realpolitik, built around d\u00e9tente with Russia and China (the promised trade war turned out to be mostly rhetoric) and a ruthless focus on counterterrorism. Crimea has been ceded to Russia and Ukraine left to fend for itself, U.S. rhetoric about democracy promotion has all but disappeared, and a concert of American-backed strongmen are grinding away at Islamists from North Africa to Iraq. Since the fall of Raqqa and the capture of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has become a stateless terror group, claiming credit for a series of small-scale attacks but nothing at a 9/11 level, which has enabled Trump to declare constantly that he has radical Islam \u201con the run.\u201d Whether this boastfulness survives his second term is unclear. Terrorist recruitment has increased in regions affected by Trump\u2019s drone strikes; Putin, after a period of consolidation following the easing of sanctions, is working to destabilize Eastern Europe once more, and Xi Jinping is making forays in China\u2019s near-abroad. The collapse of the Iranian nuclear deal has Tehran marching toward a bomb; Israel and Saudi Arabia are lobbying Trump to strike Iran, but Putin may have his ear instead. On the home front, Trump has total control of the G.O.P. (Ryan having slipped into retirement) but no real program left: He\u2019s unwilling to cut spending and his signal second-term initiative, a Mars Shot headed by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, lacks an obvious political constituency. Democrats charge that the Trump boom is unsustainable, and soaring deficits and creeping inflation suggest they might be vindicated. White House attempts to strong-arm the press into ignoring the rampant corruption of TrumpWorks have been ugly without being particularly successful. The public still has a low opinion of Trump\u2019s ethics; they\u2019ve just been willing to forgive a lot because of a rising G.D.P. So his second term could still look like the disaster that I and so many others feared would arrive in his first one. But here in the fall of 2020, halfway through the Trump era, we also need to reckon with reality: By charting the same distinctive ideological course he followed in his strange political ascent, President Trump\u2019s campaign-trail boast \u2014 \u201cfolks, I made America great again\u201d \u2014 is one that a majority of Americans understandably believe.",

        "parsed_article": "That doesn\u2019t mean that he is likely to govern as a moderate, particularly in the months following his inauguration. One thing that has united Republicans over the past eight years is opposition to President Obama. President Trump is likely to spend his first days in office undoing his predecessor\u2019s executive orders on climate change, gun control, financial regulation and anti-deportation protections for the children of undocumented immigrants. (Mr. Trump may not pursue those children, but he won\u2019t protect them.) The Iran nuclear deal and trade agreements are also top candidates for repudiation. While Republicans can\u2019t issue a Roman-style damnatio memoriae effacing Mr. Obama\u2019s name and image from the historical record, they will do all they can to erase his legacy. This won\u2019t do much to encourage bipartisanship and healing. But Republicans may be forced against their will to embrace Mr. Obama\u2019s overarching emphasis on national unity and even some of his policy emphases. Party strategists are well aware that the G.O.P. has now lost the popular vote in six of the last seven elections. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to maximize the white vote, and his more surprising ability to bring some minority voters along, it\u2019s still not in the party\u2019s long-term interest to write off the minorities, particularly Hispanics, who are a growing part of the country\u2019s population. And a party that\u2019s seen to move in the direction of white nationalism will also turn off college-educated white voters, who still form a critical part of the Republican coalition. The demands of the G.O.P.\u2019s constituents may force a revision on issues such as trade and climate change, particularly if the waters continue to rise in coastal red states like South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Republicans will run into additional difficulties when they try to eliminate Mr. Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment, Obamacare. Republicans in Congress have voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about how to replace it. Would the 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance lose it? Would a Republican version of the law retain its prohibitions against insurance companies\u2019 denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions? Throughout the Obama administration, the G.O.P. has had the mind-set of an opposition party, condemning policies without thinking deeply about how to reform them. When Republicans have total control of the government, they will bear the responsibility for its failures. Perhaps this will encourage a new Republican seriousness about policy and an honest attempt to educate their base about the trade-offs inherent in governing.

A shared opposition to Democrats has helped paper over the contradictions between libertarians, social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and neoconservatives. Now that the common enemy has been vanquished (at least temporarily), the rival conservatives will be tempted to go to war with one another. Rogue Republican factions in Congress like the House Freedom Caucus could even use the threat of a government shutdown or debt default against their own administration. The need to keep order in his ranks may encourage Mr. Trump to become a Richard Nixon-style leader, pursuing an agenda that gives enough to each faction that it remains sullen but not mutinous. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is wary of repeating the overreach that occurred the last time the Republicans controlled all three branches. The attempt to reshape the Middle East was the most obvious example, but so, too, was George W. Bush\u2019s push to partially privatize Social Security. Yet Mr. McConnell and others have been promising for years that if the party were given complete control of government, the conservative utopia would follow. The establishment may now be forced, at long last, to stand up to those on the right who are calling for Republicans to repeal the institutions of the New Deal and the Progressive era. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of Mr. Trump\u2019s support, particularly in the swing states of the Midwest, came from white working-class voters who missed out on the economic recovery of the past several years and felt victimized by globalization and elites. Mr. Trump\u2019s populism presents a stark contradiction to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s positions on free trade, immigration and cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare. If the Republican Party wants to keep its new working-class constituency, it will have to make the economy work for them. The G.O.P. is unlikely to retain these voters if most of the benefits from its tax cuts and other economic policies are seen to go to the party\u2019s most affluent supporters. One split that\u2019s likely to develop will be over how long the party is expected to maintain its control over the government. Those who anticipate only a two- or four-year window will press for the rapid enactment of a maximalist conservative program, even at the risk of an intense backlash. Others, however, will focus on the long game. They\u2019ll try to build an enduring Republican coalition by doing everything possible to increase productivity and stimulate broad-based economic prosperity, and they\u2019ll enact legislation that can command at least some degree of bipartisan support. Such an agenda would begin with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious goal of leveraging as much as a trillion dollars to rebuild our deteriorating infrastructure. Mr. Trump will not be able to bring back the manufacturing jobs he promised, but he could put his supporters to work building roads and bridges instead. Republicans could also take a page from Mr. Ryan\u2019s playbook to encourage private sector investment in distressed communities and retrain unemployed workers in the skills needed for advanced manufacturing. Other policies aimed at improving life for working-class Americans could include efforts to combat the epidemic of opioid addiction and improve our mental health system. Mr. Trump said in his acceptance speech that he wanted to \u201cbind the wounds\u201d opened, in part, by his campaign; he could do so by following the counsel of the National Greatness Conservatives who flourished briefly in the late 1990s. Long before Mr. Trump conceived of his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, these conservatives called for bringing the country together around grand projects. They were inspired by past national missions such as the settlement of the West, the construction of the national highway system and the March of Dimes fund-raising campaign, which led to the polio vaccine. They longed for comparable national undertakings that would bring out the best in both citizens and their government. Mr. Trump could invoke the tradition of national greatness by asking Americans to join him in pursuing a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which may present the single greatest threat to our physical and fiscal health in the 21st century. Or he could rally our national energies around the construction of the world\u2019s first driverless highway, or technology to restore full mobility to paralyzed veterans, or a pilgrimage to revive the economically depressed and spiritually despondent regions of Appalachia. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party should keep in mind that Ronald Reagan was able to achieve his greatest victories through cooperation and compromise with Democrats as well as a concerted campaign to convince the public of the virtues of supply-side economics and small government. The success of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration ultimately will be determined more by its ability to persuade than compel.",

All the talk about angry white men glossed over the fact that they were married to angry white women. Education was the great divide, for women as for men. Mr. Trump won 62 percent of white women without college degrees; Mrs. Clinton, 34 percent. \u201cClass shapes gender identity,\u201d said Nancy Isenberg, the author of \u201cWhite Trash,\u201d which examined how elites have derided rural, working-class Americans from the Colonial era to this day. \u201cI think a lot of people who support Trump think of themselves as being disinherited. They resent the fact that everything they believe in is mocked by the media elite, Hollywood, those boogeymen. That resentment is shared by men and women.\u201d In the aftermath of the vote, the internet was flooded with plaintive and angry accusations of betrayal from African-Americans and Latinas who noted that they had voted for Mrs. Clinton by large majorities. \u201cThat sense of betrayal is sincere and comes from a place in which there was an optimism about solidarity from white-collar women,\u201d said Salamishah Tillet, an associate professor of English and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s not like black people or Latino people aren\u2019t sexist and patriarchal. But when we thought about our self and collective best interest, we voted for Clinton.\u201d Racial fears and competition played a role for women as they did for men. \u201cThere is a racial element to this,\u201d Ms. Isenberg said of the white working-class women\u2019s votes for Mr. Trump. \u201cThey do what\u2019s right. Go to church. Try to support their families. They turn around and the rug is being pulled out from them. Groups who they see as economic competition, African-Americans and immigrants, they\u2019re getting an advantage that is not extended to poor rural whites.\u201d Women were upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 his mockery of a former Miss Universe, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, accusations piling up \u2014 across party and class lines. Yet many voted for him anyway. Of women who voted for Mr. Trump, 78 percent said they were bothered to some extent, and 11 percent a lot, by his treatment of women.

At a Trump rally in western Pennsylvania a few days after the tape came out in October, many women said they didn\u2019t like his comments but dismissed them as how men talk when they\u2019re alone \u2014 and some women, too. \u201cAt times, Donald Trump is crass,\u201d said Robbie Matuszko, who attended the rally with her grown son. But she argued that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband had \u201cdisgraced\u201d the White House. \u201cI would gladly see a woman in the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not under a desk in the White House.\u201d What did female Trump voters care about more than any mythical idea of gender solidarity? Exit polls show that they were most worried about immigration, terrorism and the impact of trade on jobs. They thought Obamacare went too far, and the government was too intrusive. These are the kinds of issues that have motivated women to vote Republican in past elections, said Ms. Lake, who wrote \u201cWhat Do Women Want?\u201d with Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. And women can be just as prone to gender stereotypes as men. \u201cWe knew going into this election how much hatred there was for Hillary, and a lot of that hatred was from women,\u201d said Lynn Povich, the author of \u201cThe Good Girls Revolt.\u201d \u201cWhy? Because she didn\u2019t leave Bill? Because she didn\u2019t want to bake cookies? Because she\u2019s a crook?\u201d Exit polls and interviews showed that many women labeled her dishonest and untrustworthy; gender research has found that women are punished more than men for such traits. So women did not link arms, and white women did not turn out in droves to send a person to the White House who looked like them. But the eruption of anger at white women, and the idea that women abandoned a woman, are misplaced. Ms. Lake and several other analysts note that Mrs. Clinton won majorities of many other women \u2014 married women, who have historically voted Republican; college-educated women; minority women; unmarried women.

In 12 battleground states, the analysis found, a majority of women voted for Mrs. Clinton. Yet many remain wistful. The lure of the dream endures, as well as pain that sexism was somehow acceptable. \u201cPeople voted for Obama out of hope and inspiration and proof that one is not racist,\u201d Professor Tillet said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people voted for Hillary as proof they were not sexist.

A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could result in a trade war that would cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is a huge $5.8 trillion tax cut unaccompanied by specificity around what expenses would be cut to pay for it. (Indeed, the president-elect has proposed more spending on defense and infrastructure.) As soon as Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendancy became clear on Tuesday night, interest rates on Treasuries began to rise. Usually, an unexpected event causes a flight to the safety of government debt, pushing yields down. That the opposite occurred reflects fears that the deficit might balloon out of control. Mr. Trump has promised to keep Medicare and Social Security benefits unchanged, a commitment at odds with Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s own economic proposals. As a fiscal conservative, Mr. Ryan is unlikely to accept large tax cuts unaccompanied by major spending reductions. That could lead to the evisceration of many of the discretionary federal programs \u2014 think education or research and development \u2014 critical to putting our economy on a stronger footing. To be sure, a tax cut on its own would give Americans more cash to spend. But according to the Tax Policy Center, by 2025, 51 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s reductions would go to the top 1 percent, who both least need it and would be least likely to spend it. Tax Cuts, Most for the Wealthy How the reductions in Trump\u2019s plan would be divided among taxpayers by 2025.

Then there\u2019s the regulatory arena, where Mr. Trump also has a free hand to act unilaterally. And act he has promised to do, starting with a moratorium on new rules not required by Congress and a reversal of many executive orders. If Mr. Trump sticks to his pledge, it will be open season on regulations, as businesses go after their most disliked provisions and agencies. Industrial companies will take aim at the Environmental Protection Agency. Financial institutions, including the big banks, will push to repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s just for starters. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are united in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, potentially ending the free or subsidized coverage that 20 million Americans are now receiving. Those Americans would be facing higher costs or loss of coverage. Some of the efforts at dismantling government may face hurdles in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to break filibusters, more than the Republicans will have. But under a process known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d matters relating to taxes and spending \u2014 and potentially the repeal of Obamacare \u2014 can be passed by a simple majority of 51.

The conservative American Action Forum calculated that his deportation plan would cost $400 billion to $600 billion and, because there are not enough citizens and legal residents to fill the demand, the plan would shrink the labor force and reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion. It\u2019s hard to know whether the conflicting forces unleashed by Mr. Trump will create a recession. For the moment, at least, the stock market is betting no. But in addition to higher interest rates, financial markets are signaling higher inflation rates. This much is certain: Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals would confer vast monetary gains on wealthy Americans while leaving middle- and working-class Americans \u2014 his electoral base \u2014 further behind.

As the Upshot article points out, this can lead to high use of expensive emergency room care. Retail clinics located in pharmacies, some supermarkets and mass merchandisers are a potential solution. They offer low-cost, quality care at convenient hours. A 2010 article in the journal Health Affairs found that 13.7 percent to 27.1 percent of all emergency room visits could take place at an on-demand care site such as a retail clinic or an urgent care clinic at a potential cost savings of $4.4 billion annually. Although the American Medical Association and other physician trade associations have expressed concerns about them, retail clinics can fill important gaps in the continuum of care. MICHAEL GOODMAN Brooklyn The writer is a health care journalist. To the Editor: Aaron E.

In research that I performed in New Jersey, I discovered that Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield Managed Care had very low participation from psychologists and psychiatrists in practice (23 percent of psychologists and 22 percent of psychiatrists in individual and group practices). Many other plans were even worse. This artificially creates a doctor shortage, despite laws designed to prevent this lack of access. In many specialties, it gets even worse because of insurers\u2019 lack of concern for network adequacy. RUSSELL M. HOLSTEIN Long Branch, N.J. The writer is a clinical psychologist. To the Editor: I object to Aaron E. Carroll\u2019s treatment of Canada\u2019s national health care system as compared with America\u2019s. I\u2019m sure the statistics he cites are accurate, but the picture they paint is not. Obviously there are some weaknesses and areas that need improving here in Canada. But there is no one I know in this country, liberal or conservative, rich or poor, who would choose the private system of the United States.

Of course, it\u2019s your country, your decision. The point is, there\u2019s a real cost to making choices based on slogans and ideology. TOM KARSAY Toronto To the Editor: Aaron E. Carroll highlights important issues surrounding barriers to accessing health care in the United States. While I agree with him that real solutions to improve access to health care must be discussed, the real conversation we need to have as a nation is how to improve access to health care in its entirety for all of our population. Access to health care is just one facet of what makes individuals, and populations, healthy or unhealthy. A larger part of our health is determined by factors such as our socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender and geographic location. Because of this, the root of the health problems faced by our population lies outside of the health care system. In addition to systematic changes to our health care system, we must speak candidly about improvements that must be made in our education system, environment, distribution of wealth, systemic racism and sexism, and other social justice issues.

President Obama has appointed hundreds of federal judges over his two terms, and hundreds of others \u2014 including Republican appointees \u2014 will view with skepticism some types of unilateral executive action that Mr. Trump has promised. It would not be surprising if judges blocked or at least slowed an aggressive roundup of unauthorized immigrants (though they did not stop President George W. Bush\u2019s roundup of Muslims and Arabs after Sept. 11).

It is hard to imagine them standing in the way if he tears up treaties or transfers military forces hither and yon. With the passage of time, President Trump will be able to place his people in the judiciary, and Trumpian judges will see things his way. History shows that a president can usually depend on his Supreme Court appointee (or appointees) to support him if he is challenged. The greatest constraint on Mr. Trump may be the federal bureaucracy. If he directs the F.B.I., I.R.S. or Department of Homeland Security to harass his political opponents, civil servants will probably not cooperate \u2014 indeed, they may blow the whistle. President Bush faced threats of resignation by Justice Department officials over his surveillance program and leaks about his policy of coercive interrogation. Mr. Obama had to put up with damaging leaks from federal employees and contractors who opposed his surveillance programs. But many in the bureaucracy \u2014 in the military and at immigration agencies in particular \u2014 support Mr. Trump and may follow his policies enthusiastically. And because his agenda is mostly deregulatory, he possesses most of the cards. He can delay or block new financial, environmental and workplace-safety regulations without the cooperation of agency officials; he can probably block enforcement of them as long as he is able to appoint loyalists to leadership positions. The news media will also play a role in constraining Mr. Trump. His threats to strengthen libel laws are idle. The First Amendment protects the media, and today \u2014 unlike in the past \u2014 that amendment is a darling of Republican jurists. But the media can constrain Mr. Trump only to the extent that it can rouse public opinion against him and his policies. This may involve showing sensitivity to Middle American sensibilities that it has not always demonstrated. In the end, the success of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration depends on Mr. Trump himself. If he shows self-discipline, which was conspicuously lacking during the campaign, and hews to relatively moderate center-right policies, he may be able to accomplish a great deal (for good or ill). If he insults large groups of Americans, uses his powers to unleash vendettas against his opponents, places political hacks in the bureaucracy, and betrays allies, he will fail. It\u2019s his choice.",

First, they can show the same unity and discipline that Senate Republicans had during the Obama years, albeit to a different end. They can offer to work with Republicans on sensible compromises, especially with Trump, given his uncertain allegiances \u2014 and Democrats can outright oppose any partisan bill that hurts ordinary Americans. Some shrewd observers expect Republicans to have little interest in compromise. The Republican agenda \u201cis going to happen,\u201d Theda Skocpol, a Harvard professor, told me, \u201cand there is nothing Democrats can do to stop it.\u201d Democrats would then have only one good option: describing what was really happening, clearly and repeatedly. \u201cRepealing Obamacare\u201d will mean taking health insurance \u2014 and, by extension, medical care \u2014 from millions of people (including many lower- and middle-income whites). Trump\u2019s proposed tax cut will bestow an average $1.1 million tax cut on the top 0.1 percent of earners. The resulting lack of government funds will rob schools and promising medical research of funding. Rolling back environmental regulations will increase pollution and its adverse effects on health and, most worrisomely, the damage from climate change. Democrats can\u2019t simply foment during press conferences in the halls of Congress. They need an outside game too, one based in individual states, that provides tangible examples of how these policies will change people\u2019s lives. A frequent question I heard on Wednesday was, \u201cAre we going to be O.K.?\u201d My simple answer is yes. The country has survived worse. But I don\u2019t want to sugarcoat reality. The immediate future will include a lot of changes that will make life harder for many Americans. Building the support to reverse those reversals starts now.",

Yet it is perfectly possible that Trump will appoint as secretary of state an experienced Republican like Richard Haass, with Stephen Hadley as secretary of defense, thus signaling that adults are in charge of foreign policy. The thought of Trump with the nuclear codes is terrifying, but if he was to give a crazy order, no one knows if aides would circumvent it. In 1974, when President Richard Nixon was drinking heavily during the Watergate crisis, his defense secretary, James Schlesinger, ordered the military not to obey any presidential instruction for a nuclear attack without checking further.

Sure, some are racists or misogynists, but many are good people who had voted for Obama in the past. My rural hometown, Yamhill, Ore., is pro-Trump, and I can tell you: The voters there are not all bigoted monsters, but well-meaning people upended by economic changes such as the disappearance of good manufacturing jobs. They feel betrayed by the Democratic and Republican establishments, and finally a candidate spoke to them. Liberals condemn the stereotyping of Latinos or Muslims but have been quick to stereotype Trump voters. Look, ordinary Americans have not somehow lurched into bigotry, even if they have backed a man I consider a bigot. A Bloomberg poll found that if Obama had been allowed to seek a third term, he would have defeated Trump in a landslide, 53 percent to 41 percent. And just four years ago, the presidential election was between the African-American son of a single mom and a Mormon. \u25a0 Trump was absolutely right that the economic system is broken for ordinary Americans, especially working-class men. Since 1979, real hourly wages for men have essentially been unchanged for the bottom half of Americans by income. Today, we\u2019re a country divided not only by ideology but also by identity. Whites voted for Trump by a margin of 21 percentage points; blacks for Clinton by 80 percentage points. If it had been only women voting, Clinton would have won in a landslide. (Thank God for women and people of color!) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s proposed policies would exacerbate the inequity that he campaigned on. And normal checks and balances will not apply, for he will be working with a Republican Senate, a Republican House and a majority-Republican Supreme Court. One crucial check could be the news media \u2014 if we are up to it. I\u2019ve been very critical this year of the role that we in the media, especially cable television, played in Trump\u2019s rise. We need to be watchdogs, not lap dogs. The time for ranting is over, and it\u2019s time to accept the inevitable. Trump has surprised us in many ways this year, and let\u2019s hope and pray that he will stun us once again by repairing the tears he made in our social fabric. Let\u2019s give him a chance \u2014 for those are our democratic values. And if he falls short, let\u2019s hold him accountable \u2014 for the sake of those same values.",

A separate investigation tying Clinton Foundation contributions to speeches made by Bill adds to the pungent aroma of shiftiness and entitlement that routinely hovers above them. Bill only adds to it with his surprise thirty-minute visit to the attorney general on the tarmac at the Phoenix airport, a stunt even a first-year law student knows is verboten.

But he does not acknowledge that Medicare Advantage plans are paid more per enrollee than the same people would cost in traditional Medicare, because the private plans market to younger and healthier senior citizens. Thus, taxpayers subsidize Medicare Advantage plans. It is likely that the same thing would happen with a public option: The private insurers would attract healthier customers, leaving sicker patients to the public plan. It would be better simply to extend Medicare to everyone over 55; the additional expenditures would be more than offset by savings in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. MARCIA ANGELL Cambridge, Mass.

Nevada is the only state where Republicans have a solid chance of winning a Democratic Senate seat this year. The seat has belonged for 30 years to Harry Reid, the current minority leader, who is not seeking re-election. A Republican victory would thus be not only a loss for the Democrats but a personal embarrassment for a venerable power broker. It would also be a triumph for the Koch brothers, who say they\u2019re seeking poetic justice after years of being denounced by Mr. Reid for their conservative politics, and are spending lots of money to make that happen. Mr. Reid calls Mr. Heck, a three-term congressman, \u201can absolute stooge for these right-wing nut cases.\u201d He hand-picked Ms. Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general, to succeed him and is throwing the state Democratic machine behind her battle in a race that is now too close to call. Ms. Cortez Masto, the granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, would be the first Latina to enter the Senate. Her victory would be a proud repudiation of Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant platform in a state where Latinos\u2019 proportion of the electorate has grown to 17 percent from 10 percent in 2004.

When the 2008 financial crisis left Nevada with one of the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rates, Ms. Cortez Masto started a broad effort to hold predatory lenders to account. In 2010, she defied the state\u2019s Republican governor in declining to join other attorneys general in filing suit against the federal government to block an expansion of Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act.

Figuring out how Obamacare is faring has always been hard. It\u2019s been hard because many Republicans are rooting for the law to fail and try to make any flaw sound existential. And it\u2019s been hard because we in the media haven\u2019t always done a good job covering the law. We tend to sensationalize its problems, rather than distinguishing between routine ones and truly worrisome ones. The recent spike in premiums \u2014 raising the cost of many insurance plans \u2014 is a real problem. But it\u2019s also contained to the smaller part of Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion, and it\u2019s a problem that could be easily solved by a functioning Congress. First, some context: The 260 million or so Americans who receive health insurance through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid (including through Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion) are unaffected by the prices increases. The increases instead apply to the 10 million people who buy coverage on one of the private-insurance exchanges established by the law. Even among those 10 million, the vast majority receives government subsidies that will largely or partly cancel out the price increase.

In many states, however, not enough healthy people signed up \u2014 and now insurers are either pulling out or hiking their premiums to reflect the not-so-good risk pool. Since premiums have until now been well below projections, this only brings them back up to expected levels. But it\u2019s clearly not good news. How many people are hurt by these premium hikes? Not as many as you may think. If you are covered by your employer, Medicare or Medicaid, this isn\u2019t about you. Even if you buy a policy on the exchanges, you\u2019re protected if your income is low enough \u2014 $97,200 for a family of four \u2014 to make you eligible for subsidies. So we\u2019re talking about a fraction of a fraction of the population (which admittedly may still be several million people). Oh, and bear in mind that many of those affected by the rate hikes have pre-existing conditions, which means that without Obamacare they wouldn\u2019t be insured at all. Even if the direct effects of this year\u2019s hike aren\u2019t that big, could it mean that Obamacare is about to unravel? No. Most people on the exchanges receive subsidies, which means that the rate hikes won\u2019t induce them to drop out; people talking about a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d haven\u2019t done their homework. So the news is bad, but its badness is limited. Still, the architects of Obamacare had hoped to create a system that would eventually cover almost everyone. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Can the current problems be fixed? As a technical matter, the answer is clearly yes. Strengthen the mandate; expand the subsidies; close the loopholes that have allowed some insurers to bypass the exchanges; take a more active role in setting standards and reaching out to families to make them aware of their options. Some states are doing much better than others, and it wouldn\u2019t take a lot of money to expand best practices to the nation as a whole. The trouble is that Congress would have to vote to spend that money. So unless Democrats manage to take the House (unlikely) or Republicans are willing to cooperate in the public interest (even more unlikely), the easy fix that\u2019s clearly in sight will have to wait for a while. So, is the latest health care news disappointing? Yes. Is it catastrophic? Not at all.",

And the proposed alternatives to a public option, like the insurance \u201cco-ops\u201d eventually included in the 2010 law, did not have the bargaining power and reach that a Medicare-like plan would have (and most of them have since gone out of business). The argument by public-option supporters wasn\u2019t that it would or should replace private insurance. It was that having a public plan as a benchmark and backup was essential to make competition among private plans work. The models we have of successful competing health plans have a public or quasi-public option. That\u2019s true in Medicare, where private plans operate alongside the traditional program. And it\u2019s true in the federal employees\u2019 health system, where a majority of enrollees choose Blue Cross-style nonprofit plans that are overseen by the government to ensure they remain viable.

It will also pull more people into the system, creating a broader pool for all the plans. In polls conducted in 2009 and 2010, substantial majorities of Americans said they would feel better about being required to have coverage if they had the choice of a public plan. A public plan is attractive in part because it can offer a broader network of providers. As exchange plans increasingly move toward very narrow networks, this would be another enormous draw \u2014 especially for more affluent consumers who have so far shunned the exchanges. The public plan can also improve the overall system. Medicare has pioneered innovations in reimbursement, and it has improved hospital quality by imposing new penalties for readmissions. A public option could build on these breakthroughs and extend them to Americans under Medicare age. The biggest advantage of the public plan, however, is its greater ability to restrain prices. As rapidly as the insurance market is concentrating, medical providers are consolidating faster, driving up prices and creating huge differentials even within regions. Medicare hospital reimbursements vary much less \u2014 and they\u2019re typically much lower. As a result, Medicare has experienced slower per-person cost growth than private plans, particularly in recent years. On the other hand, private plans are much better poised to develop integrated systems that closely monitor outcomes for a smaller circle of providers. Just as in Medicare, public and private plans can complement each other as they compete. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The public option is an ambitious policy. But it\u2019s not hard to explain or advocate for \u2014 Americans love Medicare \u2014 and it has the potential to build powerful grass-roots support. Pressure from a coalition of left-leaning groups led by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (a group that fought for the public option in 2009) has encouraged 33 Senate Democrats, including the party\u2019s leadership, to call for a public option. President Obama has started advocating for it again, and Hillary Clinton has embraced it. Republicans have actually shown how it can be done. Changes in Medicare pushed by President George W. Bush in the 2000s created more competition between public and private plans and guaranteed a fallback public option for prescription drug coverage. This year, Senate Republicans, providing another lesson, passed legislation that repealed the Affordable Care Act through the budget process, which isn\u2019t subject to a filibuster. (President Obama vetoed it.) If that\u2019s possible under the budget rules, creating a public option should be, too \u2014 especially since it could reduce the deficit by tens of billions of dollars a year. If things keep going as they are, Americans are certain to demand greater regulation of private plans to make them operate more like public plans. Instead, we should make them compete with a public option.",

In short, he\u2019s reaffirmed the worst stereotypes about Republicans that Democrats have pushed for decades. It would be nice to be able to argue that Mr. Trump is an aberration, but clearly he has found a great deal of support. Who will believe us when we say that he does not speak for us? In 2012, an unknown, inconsequential congressman from Missouri\u2019s Second District, Todd Akin, sent the Republican presidential race into a tailspin when he argued that rape victims should not be allowed to get abortions, saying, \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.\u201d The stench of Mr. Akin hung around the party for months, if not years. Mr. Trump is neither unknown nor inconsequential. His will be the stink of a hydrogen sulfide explosion. Containment will be impossible. What\u2019s surprising is just how many Republicans \u2014 men and women \u2014 have been all too happy to smell like him. Political operatives feigned ignorance about whether grabbing a woman\u2019s genitalia is sexual assault (it is), while female supporters claimed these weren\u2019t important issues to women (they are). Voters will punish the party for this collective shrug. Alienating women \u2014 who vote in higher numbers than men, and who have voted Democratic in every presidential election after 1988 \u2014 would seem a flawed business model for the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d mogul. Women are not unwinnable for Republicans. Ronald Reagan won a majority of them in both of his elections, and by 10 points in 1984. The largest spread in recent history was in 1972, when Richard Nixon, even with that mug, won women by a whopping 24 points. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, more than 20 years is a long time to go without women. I\u2019d argue conservative policies were badly explained and liberals benefited from more emotional messaging. But it\u2019s going to be much harder to make that case now. When women flee the Republican Party in the coming years, no autopsy will be necessary. The explanation is all too clear. And yet we have to try to repair the relationship between the Republican Party and women. Not just so that Republicans can be competitive in national elections, but because I believe our policies are genuinely better for women. Democrats\u2019 lofty language about empowering women sounds great (and way better than Mr. Trump\u2019s), but President Obama\u2019s economy has done just the opposite. By many metrics, women (and men) are worse off. The poverty rate is higher than it was in 2007. Real median household income is down. More Americans are dependent on the government for assistance. Homeownership is down. Student debt has skyrocketed, along with the national debt. We now know that Obamacare is becoming unaffordable. None of this is empowering, not for working women, mothers, small-business owners or students. Whether you\u2019re a veteran or a millennial, it\u2019s hard to argue that big government has solved your problems efficiently, if at all. But before we can make that case to women, Republicans will have to earn the right to be heard at all. That will require emptying the party of Mr. Trump\u2019s enablers. Who knows how long that will take, but in the meantime, women would frankly have to have been lobotomized to believe anything the Republican Party tells them. We will also need better communicators. There are plenty of good, rational, compassionate and talented conservatives who deserve a microphone and a platform. It\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation of leaders who don\u2019t speak \u2014 or think \u2014 like Archie Bunker.

The party\u2019s appeal wasn\u2019t about barring Muslims, arming our enemies with nuclear weapons or joking about sexual assault. I didn\u2019t become a conservative because someone told me to hate liberals, or to blame people who didn\u2019t look like me for my problems. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I became a conservative because of words like \u201cself-reliance\u201d and \u201cindividualism,\u201d because it actually seemed the more optimistic philosophy. Conservatism measured compassion by how much you gave, not by how much you told other people to give. Conservatism believed that individuals, not bureaucracies, produced the best solutions. And conservatism saw American democracy as a beacon of hope to share with the world\u2019s oppressed, not something to apologize for. Now that I\u2019m a mother, those ideals matter more to me than ever. In the era of Donald Trump, it\u2019s hard to argue to the women of America that the Republican Party deserves their vote this year.

Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance costs were virtually out of reach already for many people, and rising every year. Obviously, this was a major reason a new system begged for creation. Moreover, in addition to all the people who could never get insurance, there were many who lost their insurance eligibility if they had a pre-existing condition, whether self-employed or changing jobs. Egregious hardship cases abounded. When states stop sabotaging the system by refusing to accept federal aid to expand Medicaid and when the public option is restored to the Affordable Care Act as intended, the differences will become more obvious between where we are and where we would have been, absent a leader who was willing and able to finally tackle the long-feared, monstrous challenge of building a lifesaving health care system.

And Harvard wants to increase our co-pays for every single doctor visit to $25, from $15, for primary care and to $100, from zero, for outpatient hospital care and some tests. Some costs would be reimbursed for lower-income workers, but out-of-pocket expenses would still be hard to meet.

Summers, the former Treasury secretary and now a professor of economics at Harvard, estimates that a third of men between 25 and 54 without college educations could be out of work by midcentury. Well-paying jobs that don\u2019t demand a college degree have been shrinking for generations \u2014 and technology is accelerating that trend. Driverless cars, for instance, could eliminate trucking as we know it, a refuge for many blue-collar men. The crisis is not confined to the white men backing Donald J. Trump, who has commanding majorities among men without college educations. The challenge of masculinity in America extends beyond race and political party. Economists and scholars have assembled a trove of disturbing data about the plight of men, even as they acknowledge that women\u2019s employment has stalled for the past 15 years as well. Nicholas N. Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has released the latest compendium, \u201cMen Without Work.\u201d Drawing on multiple data sets, he sketches an unsettling portrait not just of male unemployment, but also of lives deeply alienated from civil society. The seven million men who are not even looking for work \u2014 about 60 percent of whom do not have four-year college degrees \u2014 spent an average of five and a half hours a day watching television or movies. Very few cared for children or other household members, or did housework. A third admitted to illegal drug use. A Pattern of Poor Health Those outside the labor force \u2014 especially the 7 million men \u2014 are much more likely to have poor health than those who work, or even the unemployed.

Joe Peterson and Al Paslow, 61 years old and friends since high school, waited for hours the other day to attend a Trump rally in Ambridge, Pa. \u2014 a town named for the American Bridge Company. It was a resonant spot, in the heart of what was once a thriving steel and energy powerhouse. Mr. Paslow\u2019s mother grew up in Ambridge on the very street where the rally took place. Their family, friends and relatives all worked in the abundant steel mills in the Pittsburgh area \u2014 Mr. Peterson\u2019s father as an electrician, Mr. Paslow\u2019s father as a blacksmith. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cNow these mills are gone, replaced by stores, shops and offices that could have been placed almost anywhere,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cNo industry here now; it\u2019s all been lost.\u201d The two friends most recently worked as independent contractors in the oil and gas industry, earning six-figure salaries. Mr. Peterson had a high school education; Mr. Paslow a college degree. Last year, they were both laid off \u2014 no severance or unemployment, because they were not technically employees. \u201cI worked for the oil industry, which is dead because of Hillary,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. Now, he said, he was \u201cconsidered nothing.\u201d He is worried about whether his son will find work; both friends fear that they may never get a job again. The friends were thrilled that Mr. Trump promised at the rally to bring the oil and gas industry back on his very first day in office. \u201cUnbelievably, that was exactly what we wanted to hear,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cOur hearts were uplifted.\u201d More than economic loss, though, support for Mr. Trump appears to come from men who live in places where intergenerational mobility is low and who report worries about their finances, whatever their level of income, according to Jonathan Rothwell, a senior economist at Gallup who analyzed 106,000 interviews conducted over the past year. Add to economic anxiety a spate of illness and disability. American men \u2014 particularly men without a college degree \u2014 are simply less healthy than women. Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton, recently conducted a study of working-age men. \u201cI came away thinking our biggest social problem is men,\u201d he said. A huge number are on painkillers, including 43.5 percent of men who have stopped looking for work. Both physical and emotional pain \u2014 sadness, stress and dissatisfaction with their lives \u2014 were particularly acute among men without college degrees, the unemployed and those not looking for work.

A man born in 1950, who is now in the lowest 10 percent of household earnings, can expect to live 14 fewer years than a man in the top 10 percent, according to a Brookings Institution study. Smoking, the largest preventable cause of death, is more prevalent among lower-income and less-well-educated people, and accounted for a third to a fifth of the gap in life expectancy between men with college degrees and men with high school diplomas, according to Andrew Fenelon of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Jessica Ho of Duke University. Poor health makes it harder to work. Mr. Krueger found that 11.5 percent of men who were not employed cited illness and disability as a factor. Mr. Eberstadt\u2019s analysis found that nearly two-thirds of American households where men were not in the labor force reported receiving money from at least one disability program in 2013.

The government keeps almost no data on the 20 million men who are not in prison but have felony convictions. Mr. Eberstadt estimates that for men with a criminal record between 45 and 54, the odds of being out of the work force are 35 percent for white males and 40 percent for black males. A segment of American men feel under cultural as well as economic assault. Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of \u201cLabor\u2019s Love Lost: Rise and Fall of the Working Class Family in America,\u201d directly links economic upheaval to the loss of masculinity. \u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult now to say, I\u2019m a real man,\u201d he said. \u201cA real man earns enough so his wife doesn\u2019t have to work.\u201d Most economists, though, don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to go back to the days when manufacturing was king \u2014 and few women would want to give up economic or societal power, either. So what could help American men? Many of the policies aimed at spurring economic growth and supporting low-wage workers would assist American men without college educations in particular. In the short term, liberal economists and even some conservative ones back an idea that Mrs. Clinton has said she would push in her first 100 days \u2014 a $275 billion infrastructure jobs plan, which could provide at least temporary employment to a key segment of those hurting the most: blue-collar men. Liberal economists tend to coalesce around other solutions, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding eligibility for the earned-income tax credit, a proven way to reduce poverty. Mr. Summers is one of many who would push the Federal Reserve to continue stimulating the economy to boost employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation. He also argues for government subsidies to bolster the wages of less-skilled employees. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Wage insurance could address the plight of men like Mr. Paslow; as Mr. Krueger explains it, payroll taxes could be used to make up some of the gap between the higher hourly wages earned in manufacturing and the lower wages more common in the service industry. Have you changed anything in your daily life since the election? For example, have you tried to understand opposing points of view, donated to a group, or contacted your member of Congress? \"Share Your Thoughts\" Go to Facebook Liberal and conservative economists agree on the failings of the education system and urge more focus on the school-to-work transition, since so many men without a college education are flailing. Apprenticeship systems and expanded access to community colleges \u2014 both ideas backed by President Obama \u2014 could help train workers for high-demand jobs without requiring four-year colleges, Mr. Cherlin said. But conservatives worry about the cost of subsidizing community colleges. Mr. Summers would like to see more government investment in areas with bad school systems, but conservatives prize local control. Re-examining the effects of mass incarceration \u2014 on black men in particular \u2014 and reconsidering mandatory sentences have attracted bipartisan support, though such efforts stalled in Congress. Mr. Summers calls for improving incarceration-to-work programs. While debate continues to rage about Obamacare, Mr. Krueger is convinced that expanding health insurance could provide American men with more preventive treatments and promote healthier lifestyles.

Reeves, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution, argue that men must resign themselves to working in \u201cpink collar jobs\u201d \u2014 those known by the acronym HEAL, for health, education, administration and literacy. Economically, \u201cwomen have adjusted better than men,\u201d Ms. Sawhill said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are winning.\u201d Women dominate the (often lower-paying) service jobs that are the backbone of the new economy. Men make up just 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal aides and 6 percent of personal assistants, Ms. Sawhill and Mr. Reeves noted.

Mr. Cherlin bemoans men\u2019s \u201ccontinued reluctance to take jobs they think are beneath the dignity of real men.\u201d From the conservative end of the spectrum, Mr. Eberstadt flags the disability system. He\u2019d like to see it redefined as a \u201cwork first\u201d program, much like welfare reform under Bill Clinton. He cites a Swedish program that ties disability benefits to showing up for job training and job placement. Mr. Eberstadt would also like to intensify social pressure on the cadre of men who have stopped looking for work. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we had the same sort of conversation about stigmatizing or shaming unworking men that we had 20 years ago about mothers on welfare?\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not idle; they had little kids.\u201d If she wins, focusing on American men could pay off for Mrs. Clinton. She could shore up support with traditional Democratic voters such as African-American men. Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party have lost considerable ground with a constituency they used to own, blue-collar men. Angry white men are not likely to trust Mrs. Clinton, Beltway politicians or the political system. But they will need their help.",

Among the most closely contested states is Pennsylvania, where Pat Toomey, the incumbent Republican, is engaged in an expensive and sometimes nasty battle with Katie McGinty, his Democratic challenger. Ms. McGinty seems on the upswing as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign implodes, and now leads Mr. Toomey by less than a percentage point. Ms. McGinty\u2019s working-class roots \u2014 she is one of 10 children born to a Philadelphia policeman and a restaurant hostess \u2014 inform her advocacy. She would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 over four years, and on the whole shows far greater sensitivity to the needs of the jobless and middle-class families than her opponent. And while she seems at times an awkward and inexperienced campaigner, she is not inexperienced in the ways of government. As chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the 1990s, she helped organize the Clinton administration\u2019s successful counterattack against efforts by the Republican Congress to undermine the nation\u2019s basic environmental laws. Later, as Pennsylvania\u2018s environmental chief, she helped push the state toward greater use of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, not only as a way to combat climate change but as a source of new jobs in an aging rust-belt economy.

        "parsed_article": "Gail: As you know, I believe American voters are at heart deeply transactional. You\u2019ll notice there hasn\u2019t been any mass rejection of Trump on the part of the evangelicals, who you\u2019d expect to be the first to jump ship. That\u2019s because they believe he\u2019ll come through on the issues they care about, particularly the Supreme Court and a ban on abortion. Arthur: There is an interesting divide within the evangelical movement this election. Some of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics are evangelical leaders, and so are some of his staunchest defenders. I suspect the latter is mostly a function of the contempt they perceive coming from Clinton. After all, what we know as the \u201cChristian right\u201d began as a defensive movement in the 1970s in response to attacks on their beliefs by the federal government. Gail: Have to point out that the attacks on their beliefs involved things like abortion. Some might see it as an uprising against giving women reproductive rights. Arthur: Yes, evangelical Christians see reducing abortions as a key priority. But this phenomenon goes beyond the big policy differences. Even on a political and stylistic level, liberals underestimate the offense evangelicals have taken from small slights throughout the Obama years, from his remarks about people who \u201ccling\u201d to their guns and religion to the H.H.S.-Obamacare mandates, which many Christians feel imperiled religious liberty and showed contempt for their beliefs. Gail: On Obamacare once again we\u2019re talking about people being furious about the government protecting women\u2019s rights. But the other is interesting. I\u2019d pretty much forgotten about that \u201cguns or religion\u201d comment. Yet another example of the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a private fund-raiser. Arthur: Of course, many evangelical and Catholic women, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, felt it was the mandates that infringed on their rights \u2014 their First Amendment rights and their liberty of conscience. But again, it\u2019s not the serious policy differences on their own that cause all the acrimony and division. It\u2019s the little slights, even those that liberals shrug off as insignificant, that really play right into this narrative. For example, the recent dump of hacked emails revealed Jennifer Palmieri (communications director for the Clinton campaign!) writing to John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, with this little masterpiece of contempt: \u201cI imagine [conservatives] think [Catholicism] is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn\u2019t understand if they became evangelicals.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: Have to point out, just in passing, that Jennifer Palmieri is a Catholic. As am I, historically speaking, and I actually think that\u2019s a very interesting observation. Arthur: So to answer your question, why is Trump still holding a 50-point lead among evangelicals after all the scandal? Simply put, regardless of his personal behavior, many believe he will defend their communities and not treat them with contempt. Gail: He doesn\u2019t treat them with contempt because he thinks they love him. If the evangelical leadership suddenly announced that they had concerns about Trump\u2019s historical inconsistencies on all the issues they hold dear, you would hear a totally different Trumpian attitude very early the next morning. But I understand your point. It is true that the left has a great suspicion of any group that defines themselves mainly in terms of their religion. Except possibly those nuns on the bus. Arthur: Our conversation so far is making me want to dig in a bit more on something I\u2019ve been thinking about. It drives people crazy that conservatives and liberals are often held to different moral standards. For example, lots of liberals are freaking out about Trump\u2019s groping, but they sort of shrugged about Bill Clinton\u2019s predation in the 1990s.

I have this friend who teaches at George Washington University named Danny Hayes. (We used to work together at Syracuse.) He is a political science professor and does research on political traits \u2014 the qualities and characteristics people assume you possess because you are a conservative or a liberal. He finds that if you are a liberal, people overwhelmingly assume you are empathetic and compassionate. For conservatives, the traits people assume are good morals and strong leadership. Gail: That sort of presumes compassion and morals aren\u2019t in the same boat. Arthur: Well, at least not as defined here. Anyway, Danny\u2019s research suggests an explanation to me for the moral double standard the public seems to hold. It appears people are especially hard on politicians who betray the traits they\u2019ve already ascribed to them. People would probably be more outraged if a liberal politician were a jerk to his interns than if a conservative politician did the same thing. And they get madder at conservatives than liberals when they are sexually immoral. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So it might be unfair, but as a self-declared conservative, Trump might actually be held to a higher moral standard on matters of sex than ol\u2019 Bill. Gail: Not sure it\u2019s unfair. Everybody merges politics with morality on some level, but social conservatives are the only ones who include a strict sexual code that bans sex outside of heterosexual marriage. Which means that if a right-wing politician gets caught with his pants down, he\u2019s accused of hypocrisy as well as misbehavior. Tough on the right-wing pols, but that\u2019s life. Arthur: I think we are making the same point, actually, although I said it in social science and you said it in English. Gail: I have no sympathy, however, with the people who backed Trump and now find they\u2019re stuck in a swamp of sexual misbehavior. I worked for The Daily News back when Trump was leaving his first wife for his second \u2014 the era of the fabled \u201cBest Sex I\u2019ve Ever Had\u201d headline. Anybody who didn\u2019t figure this was coming was not doing their due diligence. Arthur: Due diligence? No way! It\u2019s way more fun to live on the edge. This election is like driving 90 m.p.h. at night without headlights. While drunk. Gail: We\u2019re certainly in a very peculiar political place this year. Everywhere you look there\u2019s a sex scandal \u2014 where\u2019s Mitt Romney when we really need him? Arthur: Agree totally. Very notable, however, that many voices on the left dismissed Romney in 2012 as a misogynist. They held up an awkwardly worded comment about recruiting more women into public service (\u201cbinders full of women\u201d) as clear proof of secret chauvinism. Of course, this was at total variance with common sense, and this is one reason ordinary people, who don\u2019t spend all their time thinking about politics, dismissed so much of the rhetoric about Trump in 2016 until it was too late. In other words, I think one important 2016 takeaway is a harsh lesson for commentators on both sides: If we go to Defcon-5 on every candidate we disagree with, criticisms will start falling on deaf ears. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: Well I do remember criticizing Mitt for his sudden U-turn on reproductive rights. On the Clinton side, I\u2019ve admitted that I\u2019m uncomfortable with Bill\u2019s role in the campaign. But I don\u2019t think Hillary can be held accountable for his bad behavior \u2014 which seems to me to include at minimum both adultery and sexual harassment in the workplace. The four women who Trump dragged into the last debate were a mixed bag of cases, some tragic. But none of them involved actual wrongdoing on Hillary\u2019s part. It\u2019s true she blasted the Lewinsky accusers as part of a right-wing conspiracy, but that was at a time when both Bill and Monica were denying the affair took place. Arthur: It\u2019s certainly true that, since Bill is not running for president, his sexual misdeeds are not relevant, like Trump\u2019s. But the salient critique of Hillary here is not that she needed to run a tighter ship at home. It\u2019s that her role in marginalizing her husband\u2019s accusers violated all decent standards about how to support women who have suffered abuse. Gail: This is the part of this campaign I find the absolute weirdest \u2014 you may have a point, but right now none of it matters anyway! We have one candidate who\u2019s demonstrated over and over that he\u2019s a man we absolutely can\u2019t trust with control of nuclear weapons. That\u2019s pretty much a bottom line. Arthur: Whether you grab women\u2019s genitals without permission is now a proxy for whether you should have the nuclear codes. What a world. Gail: You know it\u2019s more than just the grabbing. Trump has demonstrated over and over that he doesn\u2019t have the minimal personal attributes needed for the job. Under normal circumstances we could have great arguments about Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, the Clinton Foundation donors, and so on. Then we\u2019d get to veer into a rewarding discussion of who has the best tax policy. But this year, it\u2019s all beside the point. We cannot give Donald Trump the power to blow up the planet. Arthur: I guess we\u2019ll see in three weeks if the country agrees, Gail.",

He doesn\u2019t really command strong support from his own party\u2019s base; his prominence comes, instead, from a press corps that decided years ago that he was the archetype of serious, honest conservatism, and clings to that story no matter how many times the obvious fraudulence and cruelty of his proposals are pointed out. If the past is any indication, he will quickly be forgiven for his moral spinelessness in this election, his unwillingness to break with Mr. Trump \u2014 even to condemn him for questioning the legitimacy of the vote \u2014 no matter how grotesque the G.O.P. nominee\u2019s behavior becomes.

View all New York Times newsletters. But for what it\u2019s worth, consider the portrait of America Mr. Ryan painted last week, in a speech to the College Republicans. For it was, in its own way, as out of touch with reality as the ranting of Donald Trump (whom Mr. Ryan never mentioned). Now, to be fair, Mr. Ryan claimed to be describing the future \u2014 what will happen if Hillary Clinton wins \u2014 rather than the present. But Mrs. Clinton is essentially proposing a center-left agenda, an extension of the policies President Obama was able to implement in his first two years, and it\u2019s pretty clear that Mr. Ryan\u2019s remarks were intended as a picture of what all such policies do. According to him, it\u2019s very grim. There will, he said, be \u201ca gloom and grayness to things,\u201d ruled by a \u201ccold and unfeeling bureaucracy.\u201d We will become a place \u201cwhere passion \u2014 the very stuff of life itself \u2014 is extinguished.\u201d And this is the kind of America Mrs. Clinton \u201cwill stop at nothing to have.\u201d Does today\u2019s America look anything like that? No. We have many problems, but we\u2019re hardly living in a miasma of despair. Leave government statistics (which almost half of Trump supporters completely distrust) on one side; Gallup finds that 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with their standard of living, up from 73 percent in 2008, and that 55 percent consider themselves to be \u201cthriving,\u201d up from 49 percent in 2008. And there are good reasons for those good feelings: recovery from the financial crisis was slower than it should have been, but unemployment is low, incomes surged last year, and thanks to Obamacare more Americans have health insurance than ever before. So Mr. Ryan\u2019s vision of America looks nothing like reality. It is, however, completely familiar to anyone who read Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d as a teenager. Nowadays the speaker denies being a Rand devotee, but while you can at least pretend to take the boy out of the cult, you can\u2019t take the cult out of the boy. Like Ms. Rand \u2014 who was basically writing about America in the Eisenhower years! \u2014 he sees the horrible world progressive policies were supposed to produce, not the flawed but hopeful nation we actually live in. So why does the modern right hate America? There\u2019s not much overlap in substance between Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering and Mr. Ryan\u2019s, but there\u2019s a clear alignment of interests. The people Mr. Trump represents want to suppress and disenfranchise you-know-who; the big-money interests that support Ryan-style conservatism want to privatize and generally dismantle the social safety net, and they\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to get there. The big question is whether trash-talking America can actually be a winning political strategy. We\u2019ll soon find out.",

        "parsed_article": "Of course, as Trump acknowledged, words matter as well. On my blog, I posted an essay by a survivor of a home invasion and rape, Michelle Bowdler, who recounted that her attacker had said he wanted \u201csome pussy\u201d \u2014 and the moment he used that word, she felt that her life was in danger, that she \u201cexisted only as a thing.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story What is dehumanizing is not necessarily dirty words as such, but rather the casual braggadocio by men that normalizes assault. One study of 16,000 comments on a website for fraternity men found that the most common body part mentioned was \u201cass,\u201d followed by \u201ctits.\u201d Men posting on the site were 25 times as likely to refer to a woman\u2019s \u201cass\u201d as to her \u201csmile.\u201d There\u2019s some evidence that hearing sexist language may be linked to greater tolerance of rape. And we already have a national problem with sexual harassment: One large survey found that almost one-quarter of American women said they had been groped in public spaces. So I\u2019m delighted that at least one person, Billy Bush, is paying in a concrete way for the words in the Trump tape.

View all New York Times newsletters. All that said, Trump is right to emphasize the importance of actions more than words: If we\u2019re outraged by vulgar words, shouldn\u2019t we be even more appalled by predatory actions? And policies? Here the truth is that a Trump administration\u2019s policies might be less titillating than his words, but they would be far more dangerous. Every year, 550,000 women in America require medical attention after an assault by a boyfriend or husband. That\u2019s an issue that is belatedly being addressed through screenings under Obamacare, which Trump wants to repeal, and by the Violence Against Women Act, which a large bloc of Republicans opposed in Congress. Trump\u2019s concern about such assaults seems dubious, and in fact both he and his campaign C.E.O., Steve Bannon, have been accused of domestic violence themselves. Since he never held public office, Trump lacks a voting record. But his running mate has tended to look at what might help women and do the opposite, including voting against equal-pay legislation. Mike Pence also signed a bizarre anti-abortion bill as Indiana\u2019s governor requiring burial or cremation even of tissue from an early miscarriage. That led women to form a Facebook group, Periods for Pence, and announce their periods, just in case they might be miscarriages. At a time when 11 women a day die of cervical cancer, Trump and Pence have also been stalwart opponents of women\u2019s health programs that provide cancer screenings. They are motivated partly by hostility toward Planned Parenthood over abortions, but Pence, while a congressman, also sponsored legislation to defund Title X, the main federal family planning program. It does not pay for abortions but does help screen more than 750,000 women for cervical cancer a year. New York magazine once quoted Trump as telling a friend about women, \u201cyou have to treat \u2018em like\u2014\u2014\u201d well, manure. But to me, his language pales beside his behavior and likely policies. So let\u2019s try to pivot from outrage at gross words to condemnation of unconscionable behavior and policies. On that sole point, that actions matter more than words, Trump is exactly, frighteningly right.",

I say that as a citizen who believes that America needs a healthy center-right party that offers more market-based solutions to problems; keeps the pressure on for deregulation, freer trade and smaller government; and is willing to compromise. But today\u2019s version of the G.O.P. is not such a problem-solving party. We have known that ever since the G.O.P. speaker of the House John Boehner quit, not because he couldn\u2019t work with President Obama but because roughly a quarter of House Republicans, the so-called Freedom Caucus, were simply not interested in governing and had made his job impossible.

For the sake of the country, this version of the Republican Party has to be fractured, with the extreme far right going off with the likes of Donald Trump, the Tea Party, Ted Cruz \u2014 along with all the right-wing TV and radio gasbags who thrive on chaos \u2014 leaving behind a moderate center-right bloc, which, one hopes, one day would become the new G.O.P. But it will need to nurture a new base, one inspired by a Jack Kemp spirit of conservative innovation, not by Trump dog whistles of anger, xenophobia and racial enmity. Toward that end it is particularly important that Trump be crushed at the polls to send the message inside the G.O.P. and out that someone of his poisonous ilk can never win in America, and to strip him and his loyalists of any argument that the election was rigged. At the same time, we have to hope not only that Hillary Clinton wins the national election but also that Democrats retake at least the Senate, so she has some real leverage to forge trade-offs with a more sane G.O.P. to start fixing things: putting in place common-sense gun laws, like restoring the Assault Weapons Ban, requiring universal background checks and making it illegal for anyone on the terrorist watch list to buy a gun; borrowing money at near-zero interest rates to rebuild our infrastructure; replacing some income and corporate taxes with a revenue-neutral carbon tax to stimulate more clean-energy production; fixing Obamacare; and implementing sensible immigration reform and responsible tax and entitlement reforms. The bigger Clinton\u2019s margin of victory, the less dependent she\u2019d be, I hope, on the left wing of her party, and the more likely she\u2019d work with Republicans, as she vowed during the last debate, by \u201cfinding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\u201d I say \u201chope\u201d because I don\u2019t know who the real Hillary is \u2014 the more Bernie Sanderish one speaking publicly or the more Bill Clintonish one who spoke privately to Goldman Sachs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The nightmare scenario \u2014 ruling out, God forbid, a Trump victory \u2014 is that Clinton wins with a slim majority and the G.O.P. holds the House and the Senate. The Democratic left would have a stranglehold on Clinton while Trump, who would start his own TV network and movement, would keep the Republican base in a state of permanent anger, intimidating every Republican lawmaker who contemplated compromise. If that happens, America will be adrift. One more wish. Within hours of the leak of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape showing Trump saying vile things about women, WikiLeaks, which seems to have become an arm of Russian intelligence, leaked Democratic Party emails meant to embarrass Clinton. The Clinton camp suggested that Russia was trying to tilt the election to Trump. If so, crushing Trump at the polls is the best way for Americans to say to Vladimir Putin, \u201cYou can manipulate your elections, but you can\u2019t manipulate ours.\u201d But please, Lord, let that not be the only good thing to come out of this election.",

At a rally for his wife in Michigan, he said, \u201cSo you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.\u201d He gets points for telling the truth. But maybe not super helpful to the Clinton campaign? Gail: You really did like that Obamacare meltdown, didn\u2019t you? I can see why \u2014 it was one of the few times in the campaign we seemed to be treading dangerously close to an issue with specifics. The Clinton camp spin was that he was talking about the problems that need to be fixed. Obamacare\u2019s been stuck in a political hellhole where the Republican majority in Congress refuses to repair what everybody agrees are problems because the only thing they\u2019re allowed to talk about is repeal. Hillary\u2019s said all along that she\u2019s going to repair it. And working with Congress is one area where her record is much better than Obama\u2019s. And then of course if the Democrats win control of the House and the Senate \u2014 Arthur: Vanishingly unlikely at this point. Both campaigns have their health plans posted, and it appears that no matter who wins, there will be an attempt to make substantial changes to Obamacare. For readers keen to wonk out, A.E.I. scholars have looked in depth at both: here from Trump\u2019s plan and here for Clinton\u2019s. Spoiler alert: Neither plan is that great. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: Hillary\u2019s approach, while uninspiring, would probably work. And the bottom line is that most voters don\u2019t want it to go away. They want more doctors and lower deductibles. In the end that will mean more regulation and probably more government money, Which works O.K. by me. Arthur: It will take a lot more than marginal tweaks to salvage the A.C.A. from its struggles. The answer is repeal-and-replace, but the \u201creplace\u201d part is critical. Just killing Obamacare is a bad idea now that millions of Americans have bought in and are getting their health care from it. Gail: Replace is fine with me, Arthur. I\u2019m back with Bernie: Medicare for all. Arthur: Impossible to see how the government could make that into a total money-eating nightmare of scandal, waste and citizen revolt. Gail: I suspect you\u2019re being ironic. Which ignores the fact that Americans like Medicare a lot. My other takeaway from Bill\u2019s Obamacare rant is, once again, that it\u2019s time he be retired from the campaign. His foundation is doing great work with the poor in Africa. He should go supervise. Arthur: He should definitely retire. Gail: He can come back for the Inauguration, then it\u2019s off to Rwanda.

Suspect the average voter is more interested in the part involving hospitals. Arthur: I\u2019ve given up guessing what the average voter is interested in. Usually it\u2019s some reality TV show with an uncanny resemblance to this campaign. Gail: For me the big takeaway from the second debate was visual \u2014 Trump prowling around the stage, scowling. Sometimes he seemed to be stalking Hillary; sometimes he seemed to be trying to keep himself awake. Advertisement Continue reading the main story All I could think of was Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live. He\u2019s going to be our national Trump image the way Tina Fey took over Sarah Palin. Arthur: I thought Trump\u2019s brooding character on stage was very Brando, actually. Gail: And we\u2019ve all noticed the deep, deep irony of Hillary \u2014 who Trump keeps suggesting is so sick she can barely walk down the street \u2014 standing there slugging away while her opponent looked as if he needed a nap. As much as I\u2019d like to say Trump was the loser on Sunday, I guess he did pretty well in the sense that he beat expectations. Real gift to be a candidate where the expectations are that after 15 minutes you\u2019ll start howling and wander off the stage. Arthur: It was a draw insofar as there was no knockout, and hyperpartisans on both sides are claiming unilateral victory. Gail: The real loser was maybe Mike Pence. First Trump said he flat-out disagreed with Pence\u2019s program on Syria, then added that he hadn\u2019t ever gotten around to talking with Pence about it. That was pretty harsh, given the way Pence spent his debate defending Trump even when it required \u2014 um, fictionalization. Arthur: Pence is certainly better liked among conventional conservatives than his running mate. But he\u2019s in a strange position right now because Trump\u2019s approach is so completely unconventional. To stay on the Brando theme, it\u2019s like trying to be the #2 guy to Colonel Kurtz in \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Gail: I like that image. Cabinet members come to Pence with a question, and he says \u201cLet me go into the cave and check.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Arthur: Speaking of the V.P. candidates, I find it ironic it is that some are now judging the V.P. candidates with standards of common decency to which they\u2019ve never held the presidential candidates in this election. Many who criticized Kaine for being unpleasant in last week\u2019s V.P. debate \u2014 which seems like it happened months ago \u2014 have no problem with Trump. Selective outrage at its finest. Gail: Kaine is not an unpleasant guy at all, and compared to Trump, he\u2019s St. Therese, the Little Flower. However, Debate Kaine did have an unpleasant strategic tic with all the interrupting. Arthur: He definitely failed the \u201cI want to have a beer with that guy\u201d test. As for the sainthood test, that one is way above either of our pay grades. Gail: But Kaine\u2019s antics paled completely compared to Trump\u2019s behavior on Sunday. The faces and the prowling and the looming! Not only did you not want to have a beer with that guy \u2014 you didn\u2019t want to see him walking into the bar. I remember once describing a prominent official as a guy who if he showed up at a grocery store, everyone would switch lines to make sure they weren\u2019t stuck having to make small talk with him at checkout. If Debate Trump was headed into the store, the other customers would run shrieking out the back door. Arthur: That\u2019s basically what dozens of Republican leaders did this week. Just yesterday, the news was that Paul Ryan has effectively stopped supporting Trump. Yet for now, Trump is still in it. And if you trust the polls, maybe even still within striking distance. Gail: One month to go, Arthur. Breathe deeply. We will make it. Arthur: Saint Therese, pray for us.",

        "parsed_article": "Photo It\u2019s safe to say Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate won\u2019t rival the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump rumble for great television moments. It features two middle-aged, white, Midwest-raised politicians who call themselves \u201cboring\u201d (Tim Kaine) and \u201cB-list\u201d (Mike Pence). And running mates play an even smaller role than usual in 2016, given the outsized personalities at the top of the tickets. But if these two men are willing to seriously engage the issues (and the rest of us are willing to stay awake), they could provide useful insights into their sharply contrasting plans for the future. Such an exchange would be particularly illuminating on the Republican side. Even to many in his own party, Mr. Pence, a former congressman and the sitting Indiana governor, struck a Faustian bargain by joining the Trump ticket. But he has tried to articulate a different set of principles, in contrast to dead-enders like Rudolph Giuliani, Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie. If Mr. Trump loses, Mr. Pence will likely be part of a rump of Republican leaders left to pick up the pieces and focus the party in a more positive direction. Left largely on his own while the Trump inner circle fights fires (and each other), Mr. Pence has been trying to reassure conservatives and evangelicals that he\u2019ll represent them. A social conservative, his anti-abortion, anti-gay stances are deeply at odds with many Americans\u2019 views. At the same time, he has rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the family of an American Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, and distanced himself from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbirther\u201d campaign. Though he says he\u2019s against Obamacare, as governor he backed the Medicaid expansion that was central to it. He has waffled on the legal fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants, but he has not come out in favor of deporting them. He can legitimately claim firsthand experience and some successes confronting the hollowing-out of the American manufacturing economy. Mr. Pence may in fact be in a better position than Mr. Trump to reinforce the ticket\u2019s appeal to working-class voters, given Mr. Trump\u2019s recent preoccupation with personal attacks and bizarre tweets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Kaine, the junior senator from Virginia and its former governor, will field the first question of the debate from Elaine Quijano of CBS News, the moderator. At some point he\u2019ll surely attack Mr. Trump\u2019s income tax filings. But it might be more interesting, given his fluent Spanish and service as a missionary in Honduras, to hear a clearer articulation of the Clinton campaign\u2019s vague promise of \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d What would that legislation contain, and how could it succeed?

Going to the polls on Election Day is one of our core responsibilities in a democratic nation. If we gave ourselves a pass for any year when we didn\u2019t like either option, there would be dozens of elections in which nobody came. Hillary Clinton is an imperfect candidate who is, nevertheless, extremely well qualified to lead the country. Every day, dozens of prominent Republicans say they\u2019re going to suck it up and vote for her because they think she can, if nothing else, at least keep the country safe. Newspapers that have never endorsed a Democrat for president in modern history have taken the brave step of coming out for Clinton. George H. W. Bush has told people he\u2019s voting for her. (Jeb said it was unfair for people to pass along the comments of a 92-year-old man.) When last heard from, Mitt Romney appeared to be sticking with his vague threats to vote for the Libertarian, Gary Johnson. Earlier in the year, Johnson looked like a conceivable Republican cop-out. Sure he\u2019s a little \u2026\u2014 libertarian, but he wants to whack the heck out of taxes, and he dismisses global warming as something we can deal with by eventually moving to another planet. But recently, people have begun to give Johnson the attention he\u2019s been demanding incessantly for the last year, and it turns out \u2014 he\u2019s an idiot. We\u2019ve all heard that he responded to a question about the Syrian crisis with \u201cAnd what is Aleppo?\u201d He had the same look of wonderment when he was asked about his international role models. \u201cWho\u2019s my favorite foreign leader?\u201d he responded blankly, as if Chris Matthews had demanded that he name his favorite Fiery Furnaces song. So even if voting for a third-party candidate with no chance of winning was not a ridiculous cop-out, we\u2019ve eliminated Gary Johnson. That leaves only three options for people who hate both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

        "parsed_article": "Before 1950, nearly half of all doctors\u2019 visits in America were house calls. But then the country began building big hospitals and luxurious doctors\u2019 offices, and doctors acquired sophisticated equipment they couldn\u2019t put in a medical bag. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement systems made home visits untenable. But the house call is now a better idea than ever. To cut America\u2019s health care costs, it helps to look at the most expensive patients. Medicare spends a third of its budget caring for chronically ill people in their last two years of life. This group is growing fast, and growth will accelerate; the first baby boomers are now turning 70. The expense largely comes from hospitalizations, at an average cost of $12,000. So whatever keeps these patients out of the hospital (or out of expensive nursing homes) will save money \u2014 and also, of course, greatly improve the patient\u2019s quality of life. For a frail elderly person, going to a doctor may mean that a relative takes a half-day off from work. An ambulette must be hired. The wheelchair may not fit in the doctor\u2019s office. As a result, old people often don\u2019t get routine care \u2014 and eventually land in the emergency room. Photo House calls provide that care. One study from 2014 found that for frail elderly people, house calls saved Medicare $4,200 per person per year. Medicare, then, has a big incentive to use house calls. So do hospital systems that can capture the savings. One is Sutter Health in Northern California, which runs the successful Advanced Illness Management program. Another is the Veterans Affairs system, which established Home Based Primary Care in 1972. The program has the highest patient satisfaction rate of any Veterans Affairs service, has cut overall costs for patients in the program by nearly 12 percent and reduced hospitalization of them by one quarter. But most hospitals are fee-for-service: they benefit from having more patients, not fewer. Today two-thirds of doctors are employed by hospitals, which buy practices in part to require doctors to send them patients. And that percentage is growing fast. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For house calls to spread, they must be feasible in a fee-for-service universe. That\u2019s the purpose of Independence at Home, an experiment of the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (It\u2019s one of numerous Obamacare experiments in paying for quality of care, not quantity.) Independence worked with 15 medical practices to give them part of the money saved by house calls. Over all, it has saved Medicare $25 million in its first year and $10 million in its second. (A bill in the Senate would make the program permanent.) About half the participating practices did well enough on quality and savings to earn a share of the funds not spent. One is the Medical House Call Program at MedStar Washington Hospital Center. K. Eric De Jonge, its founder (and incoming president of the American Academy of Home Care Medicine), said the program ran at a loss until Independence at Home\u2019s first year, when earnings from the pilot made up 40 percent of the entire program\u2019s revenues. \u201cThis converted us from operating at a loss to being close to a break-even operation,\u201d he said. Shohreh Taavoni is a co-founder and chief medical officer of Grumet\u2019s group, Doctors Making House Calls. \u201cI had a patient who, before I took care of her, was in the hospital every two months,\u201d Taavoni said. \u201cShe has congestive heart failure and labile blood pressure. Her daughter emails me saying \u2018her breathing is abnormal\u2019 or \u2018her blood pressure is up, or down.\u2019 I go over within 24 hours, adjust her medicines a little, and we manage to take care of it. Since I started taking care of her 10 years ago, she hasn\u2019t gone to the hospital at all.\u201d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters. A home visit can be better medicine in other ways as well. \u201cFalls are the single most concerning problem of the frail elderly population,\u201d said Taavoni\u2019s husband, Alan Kronhaus, the group\u2019s other co-founder and chief executive. \u201cYou can see hazards in the house. What the refrigerator is filled with. What the pill bottles are filled with \u2014 or not. \u201cPatients in their own environment are far more relaxed and forthcoming with meaningful information,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to the reality of the situation, and you spend the time.\u201d De Jonge argues that seeing a patient at home is crucial for understanding her important nonmedical needs, and getting her the right social support and daily personal help. A study of the Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors Program in New York, for example, found that it reduced patients\u2019 pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Photo Time is another advantage. House calls eliminate no-shows. So doctors don\u2019t have to do the double- and triple-booking that can lead to seeing 30 patients per day. \u201cWe say, \u2018the doctor will be there Tuesday morning,\u2019\u201d said Kronhaus. \u201cIf the first patient is more needy, you can just spend more time. The other patients are there in their homes doing what they normally do. They\u2019re not sitting in a cold waiting room reading Highlights for Children and getting pissed off.\u201d That sophisticated equipment that helped put an end to house calls? Now most of it is mobile, too. Doctors Making House Calls contracts with companies to bring X-ray machines or phlebotomists to patient\u2019s homes. \u201cThe only thing we can\u2019t do is a CT scan or M.R.I.,\u201d said Taavoni. \u201cBut neither can doctors\u2019 offices.\u201d For some patients, especially those with dementia, going to the doctor \u2014 or far worse, the hospital \u2014 is itself a medical issue. They can get disoriented and upset. Some patients find themselves discharged from the hospital into a nursing home \u2014 where no one wants to be \u2014 purely to be able to see a doctor. And, of course, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices harbor germs especially dangerous to someone frail. House calls solve these problems. Advertisement Continue reading the main story House calls have some disadvantages for doctors. One is driving. When Grumet first started, she might spend hours in the car each day. But now that the practice has 75 clinicians \u2014 and she has seniority \u2014 she can focus on a small area. \u201cMost of my home visits are within five miles of my house,\u201d she said. Grumet, like other Doctors Making House Calls physicians, is an independent contractor and can work as much she wants, within limits. She pays the practice half her earnings for overhead. She earns considerably more than she did as an office doctor in part because Medicare reimburses home visits at a slightly higher rate. And because the practice was built around house calls, there is little infrastructure. So Grumet\u2019s 50 percent is far less than the 64 percent the average family doctor spends on overhead. Doctors Making House Calls is one of the few house call practices that was profitable before the Independence at Home pilot. The lower overhead was crucial. Another advantage has been that most of its patients are in assisted living facilities, where a doctor can visit 15 patients at home in one building. (Traveling from patient to patient makes it much harder to show a profit.) Also, the group charges patients seen in individual homes a $95 visit fee. (There\u2019s no visit charge for patients in assisted living, or for services like X-rays.) Medicare doesn\u2019t cover the visit fee \u2014 so that cuts out poor people. But many middle class families choose to pay it. \u201cWe\u2019re not Rockefellers, but this was a nonissue,\u201d said Juliette Dais, who took care of her mother, Adeline W. Dais. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to wait, didn\u2019t have to go out when there were issues in the middle of the winter and she didn\u2019t feel like going. This made a huge difference in the quality and longevity of my mother\u2019s life.\u201d One common criticism of house calls is that America is desperately short of primary care doctors \u2014 so why cut in half the number of patients they can serve? The answer: If physicians could make more money, control their schedules better and spend a satisfying amount of time with patients, more might choose that life. \u201dWe can do X-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds and fancy medical care,\u201d said De Jonge. \u201cBut also the humane and compassionate care people need when they\u2019re in their most vulnerable stage of life. It\u2019s the kind of care you\u2019d want for your loved one and your family.\u201d",

        "parsed_article": "In addition to defending and extending President Obama\u2019s achievements, however, Mrs. Clinton is pushing a distinctive agenda centered around support for working parents. This isn\u2019t a completely new idea, but the scale of the Clinton proposals is off the charts compared with anything that has gone before. And as I said, this tells us a lot about her priorities. One piece of that agenda involves 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for new children, help sick relatives, or recover from illness or injury. Oh, and in case you were wondering, Mr. Trump, who has offered his own threadbare version of a maternal leave plan, was pants-on-fire lying when he claimed that his opponent has no such plan. Are you surprised? Another, even more striking piece involves helping families with young children in several ways, especially through universal preschool and public outlays \u2014 subsidies and tax credits \u2014 to hold down the cost of child care (the campaign sets a target of no more than 10 percent of income.) And everything we know, both about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-term interests and her current choices of advisers, suggests that family-centered issues are close to her heart. I was personally struck by the campaign\u2019s choice of Heather Boushey, a leading expert on work-life balance issues, as chief economist for the Clinton transition team. That tells me a lot about priorities. But why should helping working parents be such a priority? It looks to me like an attempt to focus on the problems of the real America \u2014 not the white, rural \u201creal America\u201d of right-wing fantasies, but the real, real America in which most of our fellow citizens live. And that America is one in which working parents are the norm, in which stay-at-home mothers are a distinct minority, and in which the problem of how to take care of children while making ends meet is central to many people\u2019s lives.

Most of these working mothers are surely doing so out of economic necessity, and we as a society need to find a way to reconcile this reality with the need to raise our children well. I suppose a free market purist might question why we need government policies to help deal with this new reality. But we are, after all, talking about the fate of children, who are to some extent a common responsibility. Furthermore, child care economics is in some ways like health economics: for a variety of reasons, mostly coming down to the fact that we\u2019re dealing with people, not things, we can\u2019t trust unregulated markets to deliver a decent outcome. So anyone who complains that there aren\u2019t big new ideas in this campaign simply isn\u2019t paying attention.

One is the shallow and faulty information transmitted in the majority of news media. The second is citizens\u2019 lack of knowledge of American political history. Without solid factual information and lacking an education in government and history, voters cannot make sensible decisions and are easily bamboozled by demagogues \u2014 clearly the situation in America today. Democracy cannot function with an ill-informed, ignorant and politically illiterate electorate. JOSEPHINE DONOVAN Urbana, Ill. The Donald Trump debacle is reminiscent of the rise of totalitarian figures, who woo the disaffected by making them think that someone is taking something away from them that is rightfully theirs and that a show of brute strength in a leader is more important than the truth of what he says. Democracy will survive in America because of the checks and balances of a strong two-party system, but the public face and the heart and soul of our nation, as perceived at home and abroad, could suffer a horrific blow if this ignorant man should reach its highest office. BERNARD LANGS New Providence, N.J. Many reasons explain the popularity of candidates such as Donald Trump, but one that stands out is the increasing distrust we feel toward our institutions and toward one another, as well documented in recent surveys. This in turn leads to a lowered sense of community and a weakening of our democracy. The way forward, no matter who wins the election, is to rebuild trust and community feeling. This can best begin on a local level. All of us, leaders and community members alike, have a necessary role to play in creating cohesive, inclusive, sustainable and participatory local community life \u2014 which is the keystone of democratic self-rule, and of democracy itself. BILL BERKOWITZ Arlington, Mass. The writer, emeritus professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts Lowell, is a founding contributor to the Community Tool Box, a community building website. Thinking about what is at stake for America\u2019s future is very difficult when a citizen is preoccupied with what is at stake for his or her own future. It is debatable as to whether Donald Trump has done a service to the country by \u201cletting out the dogs,\u201d but he is forcing us to see who we really are as a nation. Actually, this election is democracy in action; now let\u2019s see if it really works. MICHAEL SCHWARTZ Dix Hills, N.Y. Blaming Donald Trump for the demise of the American democracy and for his own popularity seems incongruous. With our legislature composed mostly of millionaires, elected through a gerrymandered system, funded by a precious few and managed by an established elite, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 and Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u2014 may represent a desperate last gasp to reaffirm true democracy. That being said, Mr. Trump scares the hell out of me. But he is a symptom of a failing republic, not the cause. ROBERT READ THRUN Covington, Ky. Democracy requires a well-informed and engaged citizenry to function properly. Unfortunately American voters are updated about politics and current affairs by media outlets increasingly intent on ratings and financial performance. As a result, much of the political discourse on television is little more than partisan entertainment. Ironically, some of our best political pundits are comedians. Donald Trump, the reality TV star, has taken full advantage of this media circus. Whatever you may think about Mr. Trump, you must admit he has manipulated the media masterfully. He consistently engages in outrageous behavior, which would disqualify other candidates, to obtain vast amounts of free publicity. This is not the twilight of democracy. Rather, it is the dawn of reality-show entertainment politics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story JERRY WALLINGFORD San Diego In \u201cWhy So Many Business Leaders Are Tiptoeing Around Trump\u201d (DealBook column, Sept. 20), Andrew Ross Sorkin describes conversations with many chief executives who criticize Donald Trump but add, \u201cI could never say that on the record\u201d because he could bully them, their families and their companies. Self-silencing because of fear is a hallmark of societies under dictatorships. Yes, our democracy will be endangered if Mr. Trump is elected. Merely contemplating the possibility, some Americans are already less free. JENNY GOLUB New York In recent memory, we survived Watergate and the re-election of George W. Bush. Our institutions are strong, and our faith in them keeps us from tearing up flagstones and throwing bombs rather than waiting for the next election cycle. Much as I abhor the notion, should Donald Trump win, we may rationally hope that in four, or at most eight, years, we will have a new president as different from him as President Obama was from George W. Bush. This dialectic process is messy, but I hope and believe that it will continue. A lot of Mr. Trump\u2019s support is anarchic, based on the notion that the status quo is so awful that any alternative, no matter how risky, is preferable. Unless pigs fly in a Trump presidency and he really grows in the job, which I do not read as a good bet, his supporters will soon learn that he has nothing to offer beyond narcissistic pomposity. They will see yesterday\u2019s bad become today\u2019s awful. There will be a big swing in the other direction toward, possibly, the next Bernie Sanders. HAROLD BROWN New York Yes, Donald Trump would usher in the twilight of democracy. While most of the media attention has been devoted to Mr. Trump\u2019s bullying, sleazy business history,and outrageous statements, what he says he will do if elected is even more frightening. He is going to build \u201cthe wall\u201d and forcibly relocate millions of undocumented residents; reduce Chinese imports, which would likely trigger a trade war; keep Muslims from entering the country; roll back environmental regulations; eliminate Obamacare; and appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. The list goes on. While Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal as an agent for change explains much of his support, if his agenda becomes reality, America would fundamentally change in dangerous ways. We have seen radical change before \u2014 in Russia 100 years ago, in Germany in the 1930s and in China in the 1940s. We have also seen strongmen. They only get worse when in power. \u201cThe twilight of democracy\u201d is staring us in the face.

Democracy is also \u201ca work in progress,\u201d as Mr. Schmidt says, and needs constant attention. But money talks in America, perhaps louder than ever, making it even more difficult to give ordinary Americans a voice. Electing the rich, self-indulgent Donald Trump, who has little regard for rules and regulations that don\u2019t suit him, and no regard for people who don\u2019t adore him, would be a calamity for our democracy that could take decades to repair. Mr. Puner and others say they are confident that our democracy can withstand the challenge, but the prospect of a Trump presidency, along with a compliant Congress and a Supreme Court with Trump appointees, leaves me deeply concerned. Our strong democracy notwithstanding, prudence dictates that we do all we can to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. This may also be the election that mandates a deeper understanding of the American people. Mr. Berkowitz says that the distrust we feel toward one another and toward our institutions weakens our democracy. I agree that many Americans have ceased to see our nation as one community. That is surely more difficult as America becomes more diverse, ethnically, racially and religiously. But we need to try. I believe that our Constitution points the way. We are all equal under the law. I believe that we can recover our sense of one nation indivisible if our institutions, schools, churches and others recognize their responsibility to help bring us together.

        "parsed_article": "Mr. Trump seems oblivious to these trends. His sparse health care proposal is built around a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without any regard for the millions of people who would be hurt by that change. Twenty million Americans have gained health care coverage in the six years since the law was passed, bringing the uninsured rate to a record low. The law has problems \u2014 for example, there are too few insurers offering coverage on the health exchanges in rural and suburban areas \u2014 that the next president and Congress will need to fix. But it is generally working effectively and has cost the government less than expected, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Deductibles Rise Even Faster +302% Increase in deductibles for individual plans since 2006 300% 200 100 +29% earnings +19% inflation \u201906 \u201910 \u201916 Mr. Trump says he would replace the law\u2019s subsidies and Medicaid expansion with tax deductions for health insurance premiums paid by individuals and families. But that would primarily benefit the rich, not the millions of low-income and middle-class people who would lose coverage if the law were dismantled. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan also includes several vague ideas for lowering costs. One of them is to increase competition among pharmaceutical companies, but Mr. Trump does not say how he would do that. Mrs. Clinton clearly understands the issues and has some plans that could help. Deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have risen for workers covered by employer-based plans as businesses have shifted more costs onto employees. Mrs. Clinton wants to provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 to help people pay out-of-pocket costs, including for prescription drugs. That\u2019s a good idea, but it would be even better if people received assistance when they faced expenses rather than when they filed their tax returns. Another proposal from Mrs. Clinton would lower prescription drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Drug makers, of course, hate this idea because it would reduce their revenue, and they would surely lobby Congress to defeat a bill. She has also suggested ways to lower costs by hastening the arrival of generic medicines. And she has promised to provide detailed policies to reduce needless medical procedures and to root out fraud and inefficiencies, moves that could prove effective in the longer run. Health care is just the kind of difficult subject that presidential candidates ought to talk about more. If Mrs. Clinton were to speak regularly and in more detail about her health ideas, she could start building support for them with lawmakers and the public. She would also further expose the shallowness of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.",

        "parsed_article": "Another example is provided by jobs in the health care and social assistance sector. These jobs are projected to grow much more rapidly than the average for all occupations, increasing by 38 percent between 2012 and 2024 and accounting for 3.8 of the 9.3 million new service sector jobs. Many health-related jobs are poorly paid. Home health aides, who need no formal educational credentials and whose median annual wage is $21,850, now significantly outnumber better-paid and better-educated licensed nurses (median wage: $43,090). And low-wage home health aides are more than three times more numerous than medical and health services managers (median wage: $92,710). Support for expanding the earned-income tax credit or other wage subsidies to compensate for low-wage service jobs like these is shared by Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and progressives like the former labor secretary Robert Reich. The E.I.T.C. supplements statutory federal and state minimum wages. Mrs. Clinton supports a federal minimum wage of $12 to $15 an hour. Mr. Trump says he supports an increase to $10. Meanwhile, fewer employers are providing health insurance to their workers. As of March 2016, no more than 41 percent of workers in the bottom quarter of wage earners had access to sick leave. Part-time workers are even worse off. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 enacted into law in 2010 sought to ensure that all Americans without employer-provided health insurance had access to affordable health insurance, through either Medicaid, state-regulated exchanges or a federal exchange. Employer-provided, defined-benefit pensions with guaranteed benefits are also becoming a thing of the past. Among workers fortunate enough to participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans, defined-benefit pensions alone plummeted from more than 60 percent in 1979 to fewer than 10 percent in 2011, when around 70 percent of workers with employer plans had 401(k)\u2019s. Roughly half of American workers don\u2019t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. So it\u2019s no surprise that nearly half of working-age families have no retirement savings at all \u2014 and for individuals between 56 and 61, the median retirement account holds only $17,000. Here again, many Democrats and Republicans agree that the answer is to detach retirement security from particular employers, though it should still depend on how much you work. A number of states have considered creating state-sponsored retirement savings plans for private sector workers without employer-provided retirement savings plans. California, Illinois, Oregon and Massachusetts have already established such programs. California\u2019s new Secure Choice plan will require employers that do not provide 401(k)\u2019s to automatically enroll their workers in an individual retirement account.

View all New York Times newsletters. From the 1970s to the present, then, mostly with bipartisan support (the glaring exception was Obamacare), American policy makers have responded to the decline of high-wage jobs and generous employer-based benefits by gradually expanding the role of the government in ensuring that Americans have adequate income and adequate benefits. Most of this expansion has taken place in what the political scientist Christopher Howard calls \u201cthe hidden welfare state\u201d and the political scientist Suzanne Mettler describes as \u201cthe submerged state.\u201d This huge government sector is made up of tax credits, federal grants-in-aid to the states and low-interest loan programs like student loans. Many of these indirect programs, like entitlements and tax breaks for health care, retirement and housing, are not counted as part of the conventional federal budget. This allows Congress to stealthily expand the size of government while pretending not to. The individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, for example, is a tax, though an unusual one, as the Supreme Court found when upholding its legitimacy in 2012. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In terms of direct spending on social welfare, the United States seems miserly compared with many other developed nations. But according to a recent study for the Peterson Institute for International Economics by Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, this is an illusion. When tax-favored private social spending is combined with public spending, American public expenditures at 20.8 percent of G.D.P. are only a little lower than the average in 21 states of the European Union. Mr. Kirkegaard concludes, \u201cTaking the full effects of tax systems and social spending from both private and public sources into account, the United States is seen to be devoting more resources toward social purposes than is generally acknowledged.\u201d Preserving the fiction of a small federal government by relying on the hidden welfare state to deliver benefits sometimes comes at a cost. For example, unemployment insurance is not a simple, straightforward, uniform federal program, but a hodgepodge of separate state programs financed partly by the federal government and partly by the states. During economic downturns, this design often creates crises, because the federal government can more easily borrow money in recessions than state governments bound by balanced budget provisions in their state constitutions. And as Suzanne Mettler has pointed out, the importance of indirect benefits in America creates political problems, too. Middle-class American voters often underestimate how many government benefits they receive, while overestimating the cost of means-tested welfare for the poor. Unfortunately, the preference of American policy makers for what the political scientist Steven Teles calls \u201ckludgeocracy\u201d \u2014 indirect, complex, off-budget mechanisms rather than simple public programs financed through higher taxes \u2014 seems likely to persist. Looking back over the last half-century, we can discern a long-term trend in which the United States government at all levels has been gradually responding to the decline of high-wage, high-benefit jobs, by methods such as gradually socializing benefits (state-run retirement plans) and partly subsidizing wages (the earned-income tax credit). Is this a trend to be welcomed or feared? One criticism is that the growing socialization of wages and benefits, combined with the decline of employer-provided benefits, transfers responsibility for the well-being of workers from employers and their customers to taxpayers. But any welfare state of any design allows employers to pay somewhat lower wages, because workers do not have to pay for goods like retirement security or health care entirely from their after-tax earnings. But the political problem remains. Even if center-left and center-right policy wonks agree that the goal should be good lives for all workers, even those with bad jobs, many Americans do not agree, to judge from the rhetoric of politicians, who know their audiences well. The replacement of a world in which one or a few lifetime jobs in a paternalistic company that provided benefits during your working life and a pension after your retirement by a future in which individuals struggle to survive by piecing together \u201cgigs\u201d and \u201ctasks\u201d with a bewildering variety of federal, state and local social programs may strike many workers as a dystopian nightmare. The price of increased flexibility may be increased stress. The emerging policy agenda tends to shift administrative burdens from employers to the least-educated and worst-paid workers in America. Members of the professional class who are well-remunerated freelancers and can hire tax preparers have a quite different experience of the new economy than high school dropouts who, between part-time shifts, struggle with the paperwork for the earned-income tax credit, Section 8 housing vouchers, food stamps and other benefits. More opportunities for part-time work can benefit retirees, who are able to rely on Social Security for a basic income. And a Pew Research Center poll in 2013 showed that half of working mothers say that part-time work would be ideal for them. For other workers, particularly those in low-wage service jobs, irregular and unpredictable working hours are often unwelcome. The unelected policy experts who envision a future of multiple job types and a greater, if hidden, role for government in maintaining minimum incomes and providing health and retirement benefits are essentially right. The elements of a \u201cgood job\u201d \u2014 adequate income, health insurance and retirement benefits \u2014 that were once combined in the package that a Detroit automobile manufacturer provided to a unionized male steelworker in 1950 are likely to be provided, for most American workers now, by some combination of employer and government. Until most American workers are persuaded that they will not be worse off in a system characterized by flexible work arrangements and partly socialized benefits, they may continue to make unrealistic demands that 21st century politicians restore something like the occupational structure of the 20th century. Politicians should tell working Americans what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. And what they need to hear is that it is possible for all Americans to have good lives, even if they can\u2019t all have good jobs.",

It is the Obama administration that has been pushing for infrastructure spending for years against Republican resistance in Congress. It is the Obama administration that rescued the auto industry and saved millions of jobs, also against Republican opposition. It is Republicans who have undercut and threaten to destroy Obamacare, the program that low-income and unemployed people, like Kentucky coal miners, can turn to when employer-sponsored health care disappears. It is what is known as the political left that is pushing for alternate energy industries that could provide new jobs to replace lost coal jobs. And so on, and on. JACK HERSCHLAG Woodland Park, N.J. To the Editor: I am tired of seeing articles about why people like Donald Trump and why people supposedly don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton. Writing about Mr. Trump, even in the guise of trying to explain him and his supporters, gives him traction. The more we are told that Mr. Trump is popular and the more his supporters are put in the limelight, the more people on the fence will be swayed to think there might be a choice in this election. Why go around looking for people who aren\u2019t wild about Hillary and trumpeting their voices? How about some frequent, front-page and in-depth coverage about all the people who are working hard to elect Hillary; those who think she is terrific; those who want a strong, determined, informed, smart and hardworking person as our next president? There are millions of us out here; give us a voice. Give Hillary a fair shot. KATHLEEN LEARNED Seattle To the Editor: After reading Roger Cohen\u2019s column about Donald Trump\u2019s appeal in coal country, my reaction was: What makes them think they\u2019re special? Since 2014, almost 200,000 Americans have lost their oil industry jobs. Dell, Cisco, IBM and other tech giants have each laid off thousands; one Wall Street analyst says more than 350,000 tech industry jobs could be lost this year alone. Even Walmart announced 16,000 job cuts. I cannot think of any job that hasn\u2019t changed dramatically or been eliminated in the last 20 years, including my own. Somehow a certain portion of underemployed Americans blame President Obama and think Donald Trump can fix their lives. Perhaps if close to 40 percent of newspaper journalists hadn\u2019t also lost their jobs in the last decade, we might have a more realistic, better informed public.

To the Editor: Unusually, David Brooks swings and misses. Obamacare is not failing; instead, by extending a basic right of access to proper medical care to all Americans, the health law has exposed the free market as a medieval delivery system for such goods. Just as other vital utilities, like electricity and municipal water supply, have been taken out of the competitive marketplace (they operate as monopolies, with tight government controls), the delivery of medical care in this country will be elevated to modern standards only when it is taken out of the marketplace and delivered in the way that Medicare is delivered to the senior segment of our population: equitably to all.

As James Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute has noted, Aetna has lost $430 million since January 2014 on insurance plans sold through Obamacare and is withdrawing from 11 of its 15 states. United Healthcare has lost $1.3 billion on the exchanges and will cut its participation to three states from 34. That means less coverage; 24 million Americans still lack health insurance. That means less competition. Before too long, a third of the exchanges will have just one insurer in them. That also means higher premiums. Blue Cross Blue Shield has requested a 62 percent increase for next year in Tennessee and an average 65 percent increase in Arizona. Some experts put the national requested increase at 23 percent.

More than 20 million more Americans have coverage because of it, and the evidence suggests their health has improved. But it does mean Obamacare is not what we thought it would be. It\u2019s a much more modest add-on to the pre-existing system. Sarah Kliff put it well in Vox: \u201cObamacare\u2019s insurance expansion is on the path to looking like other safety net programs we know, offering limited services to a predominantly low-income population.\u201d Kliff quotes former administration official Michael Adelberg: \u201cThe exchange population \u2014 85 percent of which qualifies for financial assistance \u2014 looks a lot like the Medicaid population. And with it, we\u2019re seeing the start of the Medicaid-ization of exchange plans: narrow networks with no frills.\u201d Again, this is not bad. But we\u2019d have had a very different debate if we knew the law was going to be a discrete government effort to subsidize health care for more poor people. For one thing, Democrats would have probably paid a much smaller political price if their effort wasn\u2019t billed as an extravagant government grab to take over the nation\u2019s health care system. The administration imagined something transformational; it ended up with something significant but incremental. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are also lessons for people who think about policy making. First designing technocratic systems that will actually work is really hard. Second, designing effective technocratic systems that can pass politically is really, really hard. Third, designing politically plausible technocratic systems in a country divided on fundamental philosophy is hardness on stilts. Philosophically, Obamacare tried to split the difference between European-style government coercion (the individual mandates) with a traditionally American respect for competition and freedom of choice (the exchanges). But lawmakers couldn\u2019t stomach a law involving forceful coercion (punishing penalties to make the young take part) and they couldn\u2019t stomach a more purely market-based system. They wound up with a nonfunctioning compromise. From here on out the health care debate will return, but in polarized form. Democrats are already really pushing for the public option, a heavier state player. Republicans are pointing out that technocrats are bad at designing dynamic systems and the insurance markets should work more like traditional markets. The next president will have to deal with all this, especially if the exchanges go into a death spiral, even though the subject has been basically ignored in the campaign. It will be hard to govern after a campaign about nothing.",

What I\u2019m about to describe to you, however, is a strategy for overcoming this dysfunction. It may not be much help to Mrs. Clinton, but given 15 years or so, it can break our stalemate. The central question here is, why can\u2019t the two sides get along? Or more accurately, why has the Republican Party become so resolutely obstructionist? Yes, the Democrats obstructed President Bush on some matters, and no one on Capitol Hill is a boy (or girl) scout. But Republicans are more unified in their opposition. I once wrote a column for The Daily Beast in which I compared opposition-party support rates for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama on what I deemed to be each president\u2019s top four signature policy initiatives involving Congress. The Democratic support rate \u2014 the average percent of representatives and senators who backed the initiatives \u2014 for Mr. Bush was 41 percent (this included votes on the Iraq war and the No Child Left Behind bill). The Republican support rate for Mr. Obama was just under 6 percent (including Dodd-Frank and Obamacare). Advertisement Continue reading the main story So let\u2019s return to the question: Why do so many Republicans vote no all the time? It\u2019s partly a matter of belief, sure. But only partly. The real reason is that they fear \u201cbeing primaried,\u201d as they say, from the right. I\u2019ve had a few Democratic lawmakers tell me: You know, Senator so-and-so, he\u2019s not a bad guy, and he understands that we need an infrastructure program, or a climate change plan. But he can\u2019t vote for it. They\u2019ll kill him back home. This is the bottom-line reality; this is where the drain gets blocked. There exist groups, like the Club for Growth, that regularly pour money into a conservative challenger to an incumbent who is seen as betraying the cause. And of course the conservative media apparatus will all jump on board. These challenges rarely succeed, but the mere threat of them keeps people in line. There is one thing incumbent politicians don\u2019t want above all else: a tough re-election fight. And they especially don\u2019t want a primary fight. So why vote for an Obama or Clinton proposal, even if you agree, when you know you will be pulverized for voting yes but will pay no price for voting no? That is the problem. And that\u2019s what we need to change. If the problem is that Republican legislators fear a primary challenge from the right, the solution is to make them fear a challenge from the center. That\u2019s what our political system needs: a Club for Growth of the center. It needs to be an extremely well-funded group that identifies Republican senators and House members who might be vulnerable to challenges from moderates, and groom those moderate candidates. It would funnel them money and staff; it might also back ads against their right-wing opponents. I suppose as a side duty it has to reinvigorate the very idea of moderate Republicanism. Yes, as I said, this will take time. But imagine how different our political situation would be if such a group existed right now, a group whose reach and wrath incumbents feared. We saw a version of this during the summer, when moderate groups helped Roger Marshall unseat Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas in the primaries. And that was Kansas \u2014 hardly a swing state. In fact, the districts in which this group could be competitive are more numerous than you think. The Cook Partisan Voting Index gives all 435 congressional districts a score for partisanship; R+10, for example, indicates an extremely partisan Republican district, although there are some R+30s and a couple of D+40s (Charlie Rangel\u2019s New York district is D+42). Advertisement Continue reading the main story But anything at R+5 or lower can fairly be called a comparatively moderate district. For the 114th Congress, Cook listed 64 districts at R+5 or lower. Most of those districts would never elect Democrats \u2014 but they could, conceivably, elect more centrist Republicans. Suppose my group existed now. And suppose this fall it managed to elect 15 to 20 actual moderate Republicans to the House. Right now, it appears that the Democrats might pick up 10 to 20 seats. Put those two together and you have a real chance of building a bipartisan coalition that might be interested in passing some legislation. The same could be true of the Senate. The number of moderate Republicans need not be large to exert an outsize influence. And there are a number of states that right now have pretty conservative Republican senators but might elect more moderate Republicans if they existed and were credible. What would we have, if there were 20 or so genuinely moderate Republicans in the House and seven or eight in the Senate? We\u2019d have a functioning government again. Nothing else that I can see would produce one. There are a few bipartisan groups out there trying to do work that might seem similar to what I\u2019m proposing. But those efforts are largely ineffective. Some focus on electing a centrist, independent presidential candidate; a quixotic and indeed foolish idea, since such a candidate could never win 270 electoral votes and would only split the nonconservative vote, ensuring Republican victory. Others want to unite Democrats, Republicans and independents around some core middle-of-the-road goals. Others, like Defending Main Street, play, well, defense against right-wing challenges. But efforts like those will typically fail because they have no point of leverage over lawmakers. To get somebody to behave the way you want them to behave, you have to have leverage. The threat of a primary is leverage. Nothing else is. So this is what America needs. A few wealthy moderate Republicans \u2014 and for that matter, concerned independents and even Democrats \u2014 who are willing to fight muscle with muscle. This is, again, a long-term project. Moderate Republicanism will take time to resuscitate, and it will likely never re-emerge in the old form from the 1960s and 1970s, embodied by figures like the senators Jacob Javits, Charles Percy and Lowell Weicker. There will be very few pro-choice Republicans in our near-term future, for example. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cModerate Republican\u201d needs to be defined a bit more leniently \u2014 just as someone who isn\u2019t too rigidly conservative. It\u2019s less about policy litmus tests and more about a person\u2019s approach to process \u2014 that is, someone willing to go to Washington to compromise and legislate. For now, that\u2019ll be good enough. This new Republican won\u2019t compromise and legislate out of the kindness of her heart. She\u2019ll do it because there is organized pressure on her back home to do so. Because she will fear paying a price for not doing it. Now, I am a liberal Democrat, so you might say, \u201cWell, this is exactly the sort of thing I\u2019d expect a liberal Democrat to propose.\u201d To which I say, au contraire. With my partisan hat on, I prefer the Republican Party as is. True, they bottle up a lot of common-sense initiatives.

The Republican Party I\u2019m describing, however, could win the White House. It could be competitive again in a number of states it hasn\u2019t won in 30 years. So I don\u2019t advance this proposal as a partisan. I do so as a citizen. And to those who say this sounds good but is impossible, I offer two rejoinders. First, it seemed impossible in the mid-1950s that far-right conservatives could take over the G.O.P. It took them awhile, but they did it, thoroughly. And second, we are witnessing, right now, millions of Republicans rejecting their party\u2019s extreme presidential candidate, who became the nominee only because he galvanized the hard-right portion of the party\u2019s base. Centrist-leaning Republican voters have never been more frustrated \u2014 and more ripe for organizing. But someone has to do it.",

Americans would be able to exempt average child-care expenses from taxes, and Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would eliminate the death tax, which falls especially hard on some small businesses and farmers. To help create a flood of new business investment and jobs, the Trump plan would reduce corporate tax rates to 15 percent while eliminating or capping many tax deductions. This would simplify the tax system, making us much more competitive with countries and a magnet for new jobs. Mrs. Clinton wants to go in the opposite direction, depressing job growth with an uncompetitive corporate tax rate, higher taxes on estates and short-term capital gains, and a 4 percent surtax on the most successful individuals.

She insists that the Trump plan will cause a bigger deficit and a recession, but she is basing that on her party\u2019s view that tax rates don\u2019t matter much to growth and investment; Mr. Trump knows they do. The Moody\u2019s study Mrs. Clinton cites so often says Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would cause higher fiscal deficits but would also create faster growth and a surge in new jobs. It assumes that the Fed would raise interest rates to over 6 percent, causing a recession it attributes to Mr. Trump. A much more likely outcome is faster growth without the spike in interest rates or a recession. Mr. Trump agrees with those who are concerned about the national debt. He wants to help the private sector to grow faster and to create a debt limit that would rein in our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, which has skyrocketed under President Obama. Critics of tax cuts say the government can\u2019t afford his plan. But what the economy can\u2019t afford is the current inept tax system, slow growth and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s $1.1 trillion in tax hikes. Mr. Trump would immediately halt the crush of new federal regulations on business. In 2015 alone, the Obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2014 hidden taxes that add a lead weight on our businesses. To grow faster, the economy has to have relief from this central planning and regulatory overreach. And Mr. Trump would seek consumer choice in education and health care and a repeal of Obamacare. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The scant economic gains in the past eight years are even weaker for most Americans than the G.D.P. data indicates because federal policy favored gains for the haves, not the have-nots. Your prosperity is increasing if you work in finance, issuing bonds or trading currencies, or you lobby or arrange government contracts. If not, you\u2019ve most likely gone backward financially. Mr. Trump is proposing to overturn that stagnant, corrupt system. An important part of his transformation is a new trade policy that encourages American jobs rather than undercuts them. His position has been demonized by the press as protectionism, but the reality is that our trade system is broken. Bad deals harmed American workers and gave access to United States markets without achieving vital conditions like intellectual property protection in China. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, grew to 1,700 pages, yet still allowed Mexico to enforce its value-added tax on American products while exporting goods to the United States duty-free. The even more complicated Trans-Pacific Partnership would allow foreign companies to challenge United States laws in an international court, but it would do nothing to guarantee that countries couldn\u2019t use currency manipulation to benefit their exporters over ours. Voters will have an opportunity to decide for or against a government that\u2019s failing on health care, taxes, trade, cost control and regulation. One candidate wants higher tax rates. The other would lower them. One candidate thinks the economic recovery has been successful whereas the other thinks it left millions of Americans out. One candidate has spent her lifetime seeking the presidency. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t. As Thomas Jefferson said, \u201cA little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.\u201d It\u2019s time for one now.",

        "parsed_article": "Did Democrats cry wolf so many times before Trump that no one hears or heeds them now? That\u2019s a question being asked with increasing frequency, though mostly in conservative circles and publications. An essay by Jonah Goldberg in National Review in late July had this headline: \u201cHow the Media\u2019s History of Smearing Republicans Now Helps Trump.\u201d In Commentary, Noah Rothman has repeatedly examined this subject. He wrote back in March that when \u201chonorable and decent men\u201d like McCain and Romney \u201care reflexively dubbed racists simply for opposing Democratic policies, the result is a G.O.P. electorate that doesn\u2019t listen to admonitions when the genuine article is in their midst.\u201d \u201cToday,\u201d he added, \u201cthey point and shout \u2018racist\u2019 into the void, but Democrats only have themselves to blame for the fact that so many on the right are no longer listening.\u201d I think he\u2019s being more than a bit disingenuous about the potential receptiveness of the right \u2014 or the left \u2014 to anything that the other side says in this polarized, partisan age. There hasn\u2019t been all that much listening for some time. Also, the Democratic condemnations of McCain and Romney weren\u2019t as widespread and operatic as the ones of Trump. And this is a two-way street. Republicans paint a broad spectrum of Democrats as socialist kooks, and Obama has been as strong a magnet for hyperbole as any politician in my lifetime. Let us not forget Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s 2010 book \u201cThe Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage,\u201d or Newt Gingrich\u2019s assertion that \u201conly if you understand Kenyan, anticolonial behavior\u201d can you grasp Obama\u2019s method of governing, or Trump\u2019s insistence that Obama produce his American birth certificate. The sad truth is that we conduct the bulk of our political debate in a key of near-hysteria. And this renders complaints of discrepant urgency, about politicians of different recklessness, into one big, ignorable mush of partisan rancor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What stands out in this presidential campaign aren\u2019t the alarms that Democrats are sounding about the Republican nominee but the ones that an unusual number of Republican defectors are. That\u2019s what\u2019s unfamiliar. And that\u2019s what\u2019s wounding Trump. Democrats were indeed dire about Romney, even though many of them, including President Obama, now speak of him fondly, as a Republican whose prescriptions might be flawed but whose heart is true. Four years ago, he was a bloodsucking capitalist vampire whose indictment of Obamacare was ipso facto proof of his racism. In The Daily Beast, he was called a \u201crace-mongering pyromaniac.\u201d On MSNBC, he was accused, by a black commentator, of the \u201cniggerization\u201d of Obama into \u201cthe scary black man who we\u2019ve been trained to fear.\u201d Romney was supposedly out of touch with reality \u2014 never mind that he had governed a blue state, Massachusetts, without cataclysmic incident \u2014 just as McCain was described, in some quarters, as a combustible hothead who couldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near the nuclear codes. He was Trump before Trump, which makes Trump less Trump. And those are just the presidential candidates. Plenty of other Republicans have confronted charges of florid racism and incipient fascism that apply to some of them infinitely better than to others. Gradations disappear. Distinctions vanish. Important words are hollowed out, so that they lose their precision and their sting, and exist mainly to perpetuate a paralyzing climate of reciprocal hatred between political parties. After Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, Wolfson went on to work for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a Democrat who became a Republican and then an independent.

American runner Abbey D\u2019Agostino clipped New Zealand\u2019s Nikki Hamblin from behind in the women\u2019s 5000-meter qualifying heat, sending both tumbling to the ground well short of the finish. The Associated Press reported: \u201cD\u2019Agostino got up, but Hamblin was just lying there. She appeared to be crying. Instead of running in pursuit of the others, D\u2019Agostino crouched down and put her hand on the New Zealander\u2019s shoulder, then under her arms to help her up, and softly urged her not to quit.\u201d They embraced at the finish. Contrast that with the Egyptian Olympic judoka who, under pressure from his society, refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent. And how\u2019s Egypt doing these days? Drifting aimlessly. Yes, I know, politics ain\u2019t bean bag. It\u2019s about winning. But it\u2019s also about winning with a mandate to govern.

How will we recreate the compromise on immigration that a few brave Republican and Democratic legislators tried in 2013? How will we get corporate tax reform, a carbon tax and some fiscal policy that we so desperately need to propel the economy and control the deficit? There is no doubt that Republicans during the Obama presidency pioneered and perfected this scorched-earth politics and have now paid a price for it. They let themselves be led around by a group of no-compromise talk-radio gasbags, think-tank ideologues in the pay of one industry or another, Fox News know-nothings and an alt-right fringe, who, together, so poisoned the G.O.P. garden that an invasive species, Donald Trump, just took it over. That is all the more reason for Clinton to reach out, at the right time, and see if any of them have learned their lesson. There is no way she\u2019ll get anything big done otherwise.

Although researchers into this disaster are careful to say that it can\u2019t be attributed to any one cause, the death surge does coincide with the state\u2019s defunding of Planned Parenthood, which led to the closing of many clinics. And all of this should be seen against the general background of Texas policy, which is extremely hostile toward anything that helps low-income residents. There\u2019s an important civics lesson here. While many people are focused on national politics, with reason \u2014 one sociopath in the White House can ruin your whole day \u2014 many crucial decisions are taken at the state and local levels. If the people we elect to these offices are irresponsible, cruel, or both, they can do a lot of damage. This is especially true when it comes to health care. Even before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, there was wide variation in state policies, especially toward the poor and near-poor. Medicaid has always been a joint federal-state program, in which states have considerable leeway about whom to cover. States with consistently conservative governments generally offered benefits to as few people as the law allowed, sometimes only to adults with children in truly dire poverty. States with more liberal governments extended benefits much more widely. These policy differences were one main reason for a huge divergence in the percentage of the population without insurance, with Texas consistently coming in first in that dismal ranking. And the gaps have only grown wider since Obamacare went into effect, for two reasons. First, the Supreme Court made the federally-funded expansion of Medicaid, a crucial part of the reform, optional at the state level. This should be a no-brainer: If Washington is willing to provide health insurance to many of your state\u2019s residents \u2014 and in so doing pump dollars into your state\u2019s economy \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t you say yes?

Consider, in particular, the murder rate, arguably the most solid indicator for long-run comparisons because there\u2019s no ambiguity about definitions. Homicides did shoot up between the early 1960s and the 1980s, and images of a future dystopia \u2014 think \u201cEscape From New York\u201d (1981) or Blade Runner (1982) \u2014 became a staple of popular culture. Conservative writers assured us that soaring crime was the inevitable result of a collapse in traditional values and that things would get even worse unless those values were restored. But then a funny thing happened: The murder rate began falling, and falling, and falling. By 2014 it was all the way back down to where it was half a century earlier. There was some rise in 2015, but so far, at least, it\u2019s barely a blip in the long-run picture. Basically, American cities are as safe as they\u2019ve ever been. Nobody is completely sure why crime has plunged, but the point is that the nightmare landscape of the Republican candidate\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 call it Trump\u2019s hellhole? \u2014 bears no resemblance to reality. And we\u2019re not just talking about statistics here; we\u2019re also talking about lived experience. Fear of crime hasn\u2019t disappeared from American life \u2014 today\u2019s New York is incredibly safe by historical standards, yet I still wouldn\u2019t walk around some areas at 3 a.m. But fear clearly plays a much diminished role now in daily life. So what is all of this about? The same thing everything in the Trump campaign is about: race. I used scare quotes when talking about Mr. Trump\u2019s racial \u201coutreach\u201d because it\u2019s clear that the real purpose of his vaguely conciliatory rhetoric is not so much to attract nonwhite voters as it is to reassure squeamish whites that he isn\u2019t as racist as he seems. But here\u2019s the thing: Even when he is trying to sound racially inclusive, his imagery is permeated by an \u201calt-right\u201d sensibility that fundamentally sees nonwhites as subhuman. Thus when he asks African-Americans, \u201cWhat do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?\u201d he betrays ignorance of the reality that most African-Americans work hard for a living and that there is a large black middle class. Oh, and 86 percent of nonelderly black adults have health insurance, up from 73 percent in 2010 thanks to Obamacare. Maybe they do have something to lose? But how was he supposed to know? In the mental world he and those he listens to inhabit, blacks and other nonwhites are by definition shiftless burdens on society.

Mr. Krugman\u2019s latest prescription for what ails the Affordable Care Act is to give insurers even more taxpayer dollars, both in the form of greater premium assistance to consumers and risk subsidies to the insurers themselves. He also suggests that government step up its efforts to force healthy (young) consumers to buy insurance. The fact is that millions of Americans are making a rational decision to reject a bad product. Premiums are often the least of your health insurance costs; skyrocketing deductibles \u2014 for which no subsidies are available \u2014 make it impossible for so many to even use their insurance. Moreover, narrow networks limit consumer options so that even cancer treatment may be out of network. Unless such issues are addressed, Mr. Krugman will not be joined in his Affordable Care Act cheerleading by consumers. BRENDAN WILLIAMS Bedford, N.H. To the Editor: Paul Krugman notes that many more people are now insured under Obamacare, people who \u201cturn out to have been sicker and more in need of costly care than we realized.\u201d Many of those people, but for Obamacare, would have either died or made repeated use of emergency care. Let us take that into account when we do the cost calculations.

In Aetna\u2019s case there\u2019s reason to believe that there was also another factor: vindictiveness on the part of the insurer after antitrust authorities turned down a proposed merger. That\u2019s an important story, but not central to the broader issue of health reform. So how bad is the problem? Much of the new system is doing pretty well \u2014 not just the Medicaid expansion, but also private insurer-based exchanges in big states that are trying to make the law work, California in particular. The bad news mainly hits states that have small populations and/or have governments hostile to reform, where the exit of insurers may leave markets without adequate competition. That\u2019s not the whole country, but it would be a significant setback. But it would be quite easy to fix the system. It seems clear that subsidies for purchasing insurance, and in some cases for insurers themselves, should be somewhat bigger \u2014 an affordable proposition given that the program so far has come in under budget, and easily justified now that we know just how badly many of our fellow citizens needed coverage. There should also be a reinforced effort to ensure that healthy Americans buy insurance, as the law requires, rather than them waiting until they get sick. Such measures would go a long way toward getting things back on track. Beyond all that, what about the public option? The idea of allowing the government to offer a health plan directly to families was blocked in 2010 because private insurers didn\u2019t want to face the competition. But if those insurers aren\u2019t actually interested in providing insurance, why not let the government step in (as Hillary Clinton is in fact proposing)? The trouble, of course, is Congress: If Republicans control one or both houses, it\u2019s all too likely that they\u2019ll do what they do best \u2014 try to sabotage a Democratic president through lack of cooperation. Unless it\u2019s such a wave election that Democrats take the House, or at least can claim an overwhelming mandate, the obvious fixes for health reform will be off the table. That said, there may still be room for action at the executive level. And I\u2019m hearing suggestions that states may be able to offer their own public options; if these proved successful, they might gradually become the norm. However this plays out, it\u2019s important to realize that as far as anyone can tell, there\u2019s nothing wrong with Obamacare that couldn\u2019t be fairly easily fixed with a bit of bipartisan cooperation. The only thing that makes this hard is the blocking power of politicians who want reform to fail.",

        "parsed_article": "Photo Die-hard opponents of the 2010 health reform law, the Affordable Care Act, have often used its real and imagined problems to argue that it is fatally flawed. Now they are seizing on an announcement by Aetna that it will reduce its participation in the health insurance marketplaces set up by the law. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign called Aetna\u2019s move \u201cthe latest blow to this broken law that is slowly imploding under its regulatory red tape.\u201d This is hyperbole. The law has survived many setbacks, and it will overcome Aetna\u2019s decision, too. The law set up federal and state-run marketplaces where people who don\u2019t have health insurance through their employers or government programs like Medicare can buy coverage. Despite initial problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal program\u2019s website, and some state sites, the marketplaces have helped many Americans become insured. About 11 million people have bought policies, and the government provides tax credits to 85 percent of them to make the coverage affordable. But some big national insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana and now Aetna say they are losing too much money on marketplace policies. The reason is that the customers they signed up used more medical services than the insurers had anticipated. On Monday, Aetna said it would reduce the number of counties where it sells such policies to 242, from 778, citing a $200 million pretax loss on those policies in the second quarter. The company had sold marketplace policies to about 911,000 customers as of April. Aetna\u2019s decision will cause problems in some places. For example, Pinal County in Arizona might have no insurer selling marketplace policies for 2017 unless another company steps in to replace Aetna. But competition is more robust elsewhere. A Kaiser Family Foundation report published in July said that in 16 states and the District of Columbia, there would be an average of 5.8 insurers selling policies for 2017. That number was down from 6.5 in 2016 but about the same as in 2014. There have been questions about Aetna\u2019s motives. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the insurer could be pressuring the Justice Department to drop or settle a lawsuit it filed last month to block Aetna\u2019s proposed $37 billion acquisition of Humana. She and others have pointed out that as recently as April, Aetna\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Mark Bertolini, told analysts that he considered the company\u2019s presence in the marketplaces \u201ca good investment.\u201d And in May, Aetna said that it might expand into other parts of the country. Aetna says that the lawsuit did not influence its decision to reduce participation.

View all New York Times newsletters. It is clear, however, that Congress should strengthen the marketplaces to ensure sufficient competition. For example, it could encourage more healthy people to buy insurance by extending tax credits to families that now earn too much to qualify. Many of those people find it cheaper to pay the tax penalty for not having insurance than to buy it. If more healthy people participated, more insurers would want to be on the exchanges. Congress and state governments could also consider offering a government insurance plan in rural areas and other places where there is little or no competition, as President Obama and Hillary Clinton have proposed. Any law as complex and comprehensive as the Affordable Care Act is bound to have some hiccups. The only sensible response to those problems is to improve the law.",

And no, the program doesn\u2019t need to be more \u201cpro-growth.\u201d There\u2019s absolutely no evidence that tax cuts for the rich and radical deregulation, which is what right-wingers mean when they talk about pro-growth policies, actually work, or that strengthening the social safety net does any harm. Bill Clinton presided over a bigger boom than Ronald Reagan; the Obama years have seen much more private job creation than the Bush era, even before the crash, with job growth actually accelerating after taxes went up and Obamacare went into effect. It\u2019s true that there are things we could do to boost the U.S. economy. The most important of these things, however, would be to take advantage of very low government borrowing costs to greatly expand public investment \u2014 which is something progressives support but conservatives oppose. So enough already with the notion that being on the center-left somehow means being anti-growth. Now let\u2019s talk about the politics. The Trumpification of the G.O.P. didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. On the contrary, it was the natural outcome of a cynical strategy: long ago, conservatives decided to harness racial resentment to sell right-wing economic policies to working-class whites, especially in the South. This strategy brought many electoral victories, but always at the risk that the racial resentment would run out of control, leaving the economic conservatives \u2014 whose ideas never had much popular support \u2014 stranded. And that is what has just happened. So now the strategy that rightists had used to sell policies that were neither popular nor successful has blown up in their faces. And the Democratic response should be to adopt some of those policies? Say what? Also, I can\u2019t help but notice a curious pattern in the recommendations of some self-proclaimed centrists. When Republicans were in the ascendant, centrists urged Democrats to adapt by moving right. Now that Republicans are in trouble, with some feeling that they have no choice except to vote Democratic, these same centrists are urging Democrats to \u2026 adapt by moving right. Funny how that works. Back to the main theme: Grand coalitions do sometimes have a place in politics, as a response to crises that are neither party\u2019s fault \u2014 external threats to national security, economic disaster. But that\u2019s not what is happening here. Trumpism is basically a creation of the modern conservative movement, which used coded appeals to prejudice to make political gains, then found itself unable to rein in a candidate who skipped the coding.

But they can\u2019t expect policy concessions in return. When Dr. Frankenstein finally realizes that he has created a monster, he doesn\u2019t get a reward.

        "parsed_article": "Last week, when the Department of Justice charged three people in Miami with fraud and other crimes in a $1 billion scheme to bilk Medicare, it was the single largest criminal case in the nine-year history of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, a coalition of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. A month earlier, a crackdown by the strike force led to civil and criminal charges against 301 people in dozens of schemes totaling $900 million in allegedly false billings. Clearly, health care fraud is vast. Less obvious is that prevention, detection and punishment of fraud have improved in recent years, though that would be threatened if the Affordable Care Act of 2010 were weakened, as Republicans have long demanded. Photo Obamacare provided an additional $350 million to expand the Medicare Fraud Strike Force to nine cities, from only two in 2007, and to develop advanced data and accounting systems to uncover fraud. The law also toughened sentencing for Medicare fraud, in part, by clarifying that prison terms are to be based on the falsely billed amounts, not the amount actually paid out before the fraud was detected. To date, some 2,000 of 2,900 defendants charged with felony health care fraud in strike force cases have been convicted. Most have been sentenced to prison, not merely probation. In addition, courts have ordered defendants to repay the government more than $5.5 billion, which is about the total amount the government paid out in the frauds that have been prosecuted.

Stopping fraud also leads to better care, because billing fraud often involves ordering unnecessary tests for patients and prescribing unnecessary drugs. Fighting fraud is also crucial to maintaining public confidence in the health care system. Republican opponents of a government role in health care often portray the system as broken and unsustainable. In fact, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s improved fraud detection is only one of several ways it has improved Medicare\u2019s overall financial outlook, as was made clear last month in the annual report of Medicare trustees. Medicare fraud is a scourge. But those who would weaken the health care system for ideological reasons are an even bigger problem.",

Mr. Beck criticized me, but Fox\u2019s public relations department was mercifully quiet. \u201cThey must have liked you,\u201d a knowledgeable Fox observer told me, \u201cor else they would have put out a press release wishing you well battling your mental demons.\u201d While I was on \u201cNews Watch,\u201d I commuted back and forth from Washington, D.C., to New York every Friday for our taping.

I heard that he would call down to the control room if he didn\u2019t like the way someone\u2019s makeup and hair had been done. I was always grateful to the Fox stylists for making me look decent after I\u2019d gotten up at 5 a.m. and left a toddler at home to fly to New York. They shushed me when I asked them, kidding, to give me those seemingly enhanced lips one anchorwoman had. Watching Fox over the years, I cringed when I saw many professional women in short skirts and fitted tops, positioned in ways that seemed designed to highlight their legs, sitting next to an older, male anchor, in a suit and tie. I can\u2019t speak to the allegations of sexual harassment in the lawsuit against Mr. Ailes filed by the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, allegations that Mr. Ailes has denied, or to the reports of several other women coming forward in the internal investigation.

        "parsed_article": "Part of the decline may also be credited to \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201d Teen pregnancy was already dropping in 2009 when the show made its debut, but then it began to fall three times as fast. Two economists, Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine, found that after \u201c16\u201d began, declines in teenage births were highest in areas where more teenagers and young adults watched MTV. Google searches for \u201chow get birth control,\u201d \u201chow get abortion\u201d and the like spiked on the days after the show aired. The economists concluded that \u201c16\u201d was responsible for a 5.7 percent reduction in teen births in the year after the show began. (Teen abortion rates continued to fall as well.) Still, however, the United States has a far higher rate of teenage pregnancies than most developed countries. Three-quarters of these pregnancies are unplanned, and 30 percent end in abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization committed to advancing reproductive rights. But this could change soon, if other states copy an idea that has had a smashing debut in Colorado. Over the past seven years, that state has cut the rate of babies born to girls ages 15 to 19 by nearly half. The teenage abortion rate is down by the same amount. Repeat teenage births have dropped by 58 percent. Colorado has accomplished this with no increase in teenage sexual activity or in sexually transmitted infections. And the state has saved tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars. Photo A main reason for Colorado\u2019s success is a program to make long-acting reversible contraceptives (known as LARCs), such as hormonal implants or intrauterine devices, available cost-free to women and girls who want them. These protect from unwanted pregnancy for years \u2014 in the case of some IUDs, 10 years. Because these methods are \u201cset and forget,\u201d they are the most reliable forms of birth control. Each year 1 percent of women on LARCs get pregnant, compared with 9 percent of women on oral contraceptives and 18 percent of those who rely on condoms. When Colorado started the LARC program, only 2.5 percent of teenagers who came for family planning in clinics for low-income or uninsured people received LARCs. Last year that figure was 28.9 percent. The push for LARCs came from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which offered Colorado a donation of $25 million to pay for a five-year program. Colorado accepted. When five years was up in 2015, Republicans in the State Legislature killed a bill that would have provided public funding for the program to continue. A coalition of private funders chipped in to keep it going at a low level. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, the program is again on solid ground, because the legislature reversed itself this year. Colorado now spends at a rate only half of what the Buffett Foundation did, but it\u2019s enough, because Obamacare insurers and an expanded Medicaid program now pay for much of it. (These programs are supposed to cover birth control completely, but some women and components of the program, such as training for health care workers, aren\u2019t covered.) Since Medicaid would have paid for a vast majority of the unwanted births, reducing them provides immediate savings in tax revenues. Much larger are the long-term savings produced by a better life for both mother and child. One immediate benefit is that fewer children are born into poverty: Colorado has experienced a 25 percent drop in enrollment in the government\u2019s nutrition program for low-income women and children.

View all New York Times newsletters. The successes of the LARC program, now seven years old, have been widely reported. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends LARCs strongly, even for never-pregnant adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls them the \u201cfirst-line contraceptive choice\u201d for teenagers who don\u2019t choose abstinence. Yet other states are getting off to a slow start in replicating the program. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials is trying to speed the process. The organization runs a working group that brings together officials from states seeking to provide LARCs to women who have just given birth. In 2014 the working group included officials from six states, and last year seven more states joined. The challenges illustrate how difficult it is to spread new medical practices. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, has on occasion worn an IUD as a pin, so he can show people how small and light it is. Lots of people remember the Dalkon Shield of the 1970s and the injury and infertility it caused. The new IUDs are different. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your mother\u2019s IUD,\u201d Wolk likes to say. Photo But just because something is safe doesn\u2019t mean people know it\u2019s safe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a lot of education needed,\u201d said Lisa Waddell, the community health and prevention chief program officer at the health officials\u2019 association. Many young women haven\u2019t heard of LARCs, and some who have believe they are not reversible (they are, usually instantly), or are painful to use (insertion of an IUD is painful, but it can\u2019t be felt afterward). Waddell says the best remedy is word of mouth from women who are happy with their birth control. Health workers must use care when talking about LARCs, as with other forms of birth control. America has a sorry history of coercing young minority women into sterilization or birth control. Some state legislators have talked about making birth control a requirement for welfare, for example. That comes from a thoughtful article in The Nation by Dani McClain; it discusses why past coercion has made some women wary of LARCs, and the importance of information without pressure. Any explanation, of course, requires a visit, and this can be a challenge. \u201cThe biggest barrier is access to care,\u201d said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Greenville Health System in South Carolina and clinical lead for the Birth Outcomes Initiative, a state government program. She said that LARCs could sometimes be a two-appointment procedure. \u201cWith a prescription for birth control pills, patients can go out and fill it. With a LARC, if we don\u2019t have one in the office that day, the patient has to come back.\u201d This is one reason many states focus on women who have just given birth \u2014 it can be the only time women see a health care provider when they aren\u2019t pregnant. (On the other hand, it\u2019s by definition too late.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story But while many state governments wanted hospitals to insert LARCs, state Medicaid systems initially discouraged the procedure with their disbursement system. Hospitals were paid a bundled amount for a birth. They weren\u2019t about to insert an $800 IUD if Medicaid wasn\u2019t going to pay them extra. In 2012, South Carolina became the first state to have its Medicaid reimburse for LARCs in a separate payment. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the dominant insurer, quickly followed. Now many states\u2019 Medicaid programs pay for LARCs this way. This policy change was necessary but far from sufficient. At last year\u2019s state health officials meeting, for example, program officials in Montana reported that the state\u2019s Medicaid added a separate payment for LARC on January 1. Yet 10 months later, only four women had received LARCs immediately after giving birth, because providers hadn\u2019t been told that they could get paid. \u201cWe currently do not have a method to contact our members with new information,\u201d the officials said. Melanie Giese, who leads South Carolina\u2019s Birth Outcomes Initiative, said that a quarter of the state\u2019s birthing hospitals are providing LARCs postpartum. She said that involving everyone from the beginning was crucial to success. \u201cPharmacy, the chief financial officer, labor and delivery, claims \u2014 everybody who\u2019s going to touch the patient or the device. You can\u2019t do it piecemeal.\u201d No matter how groundbreaking the idea, it can be felled by the mundane details of implementation. \u201cLARCs have a lot of logistical issues that aren\u2019t present with other forms of birth control,\u201d said Crockett. \u201cThere are a lot of issues with billing, the time it takes to do the insertion, and with stocking the devices. I\u2019m very committed to making LARC available, and even I\u2019m struggling with these issues in my hospital. I learned it really takes leadership.\u201d",

If you\u2019re part of the working class, and looking for drastic changes beyond tax cuts for the wealthy that are alleged to dribble down, Pence is a message that you\u2019re out of luck. Arthur: So you think this was a political mistake for Trump. Gail: I guess it makes perfect sense for calming down the party leadership heading into the homestretch. But if I ever had any delusions that Trump actually had a genuine plan for change, I would be \u2026 depressed. Enough about me \u2014 you\u2019re the one who knows Pence. Tell me why he\u2019s a good choice. Arthur: The first thing to know is that for conservative activists, there are actually two Mike Pences. The first is Congressman Mike Pence, who was indeed a conservative in the policy mold of Paul Ryan. He was so popular when he was in the House that many people thought he should run for president. The second is Governor Mike Pence, who is seen somewhat less positively by some of the conservative base, because he allowed Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, and for the way he handled the controversy about religious freedom \u2014 i.e. the gay wedding cake controversy, in which he initially supported legislation guaranteeing freedom of conscience for certain small business owners and then changed course when it became a national controversy.

Hehehe. Arthur: That\u2019s the one. So all in all it\u2019s not clear to me how he will be received, once the news sinks in. But in any case, I think he will turn out to be a positive asset in the long run because of his personality, which is fundamentally friendly, optimistic and aspirational. I promise you that if we had lunch with him, you\u2019d like him. The offset to Trump is not his policies, but rather the fact that Pence is always nice to people. That\u2019s almost an eccentricity in today\u2019s politics, like wearing a monocle. Another plus about Pence is that people can imagine him being the president. Just in case Trump gets bored, I mean. I\u2019ll be keen to see how this bumps Trump\u2019s (hey, that rhymes) poll numbers along with the convention. And speaking of that, I think I was right that the FBI email thing really brought Clinton down. Recent polls have them tied, and the accompanying qualitative analysis suggests that people really think she\u2019s dishonest. How can she win back some trust and get back in the lead?

Obviously she\u2019ll do other things to try to convince the public she has a vision of change for the better. But the absolute hands-down winning argument is the stupendous terribleness of her opponent. Arthur: Compelling: \u201cVote for me! I know you all think I\u2019m dishonest but the other guy is worse!\u201d By the way, I heard her tell the following joke in a speech last week: \u201cI don\u2019t know who created \u2018Pokemon Go,\u2019 but I\u2019m trying to figure out how to get them to have Pokemon Go to the Polls!\u201d Seriously Gail, would you trust the nuclear codes to someone who thinks that\u2019s funny? Gail: On the other hand, do you really think that the majority of American voters are going to decide, in the end, that they want a president who can\u2019t even choose a running mate in a seemly manner? Not to mention all the business disasters and unpaid construction workers. Arthur: \u201cHow to choose a running mate in a seemly manner\u201d sounds like something rich political kids learn at cotillion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: Point taken. I guess we\u2019ll just have to go back to all those stiffed workers and bankrupt casinos. Arthur: They\u2019ll be showing up in Clinton\u2019s commercials, no doubt. Before we quit, can we talk just for a second about the controversy surrounding Justice Ginsburg\u2019s comments about Trump last week? She gave several interviews in which she made openly disparaging comments about the Republican nominee, calling him \u201ca faker,\u201d and saying, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2014 with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that.\u201d Gail: That did happen, Arthur. Personally, I would rather change the subject, move on and make fun of the vice-presidential selection process. But you go ahead. Arthur: Sorry, bear with me here. People were pretty outraged that a Supreme Court justice would talk in such an openly partisan way, and of course Trump denounced it. Even The Times said Trump was right and Justice Ginsburg was way out of line. (Although Trump also took to Twitter with the subtle commentary that her \u201cmind is shot,\u201d with which I\u2019m going to guess the Times editorial board did not fully agree.) She wound up apologizing, but not before The Wall Street Journal said she should resign. Gail: As you know, I no longer have any role on the editorial board, but I did agree with that editorial. Arthur: She also made a comment that went relatively unremarked in the interview, about the late Justice Antonin Scalia. You and I talked a couple of months ago about their great friendship, which transcended their political disagreements. But in the interview, she seemed sort of relieved that he wasn\u2019t around because it would have decided a couple of cases differently: \u201cThink what would have happened had Justice Scalia remained with us.\u201d That made me feel a tiny bit sad. Gail: O.K., you are making too big a deal of that part. I didn\u2019t like the Trump comments because they were so unnecessary, and dragged Ginsburg into a controversy she in no way needed to become part of. The Scalia thing might not have been a perfect wording, but it is a truth known to everyone that if he had been around for the most recent decisions, the nation would be in a different, and in my opinion worse, place. Arthur: No shock, but I would much prefer Supreme Court decisions that went the other way. But the rules are the rules. So I know you\u2019re heading to Cleveland today. You\u2019ll have to have enough fun for the both of us. No doubt we\u2019ll have a lot to talk about next week. Safe travels.

        "parsed_article": "Still, too many people have been left out. For one thing, 19 states, including Florida, North Carolina and Texas, still have not expanded Medicaid, even though the federal government offered to pay the full cost for the first three years and 90 percent starting in 2020. If these states had opted in, four million more people would be eligible. But the Republicans who control the governments in these states are ideologically opposed to the health reform law. Slower Growth in Health Costs Annual rates for health care inflation and overall inflation. Health care inflation rate Obama- care 12% 10 Avg. annual rise in health costs: 1.6% 8 6 4 2 Overall inflation 0 \u201960 \u201970 \u201980 \u201990 \u201900 \u201910 \u201915 12% Health care inflation rate 10 Affordable Care Act Avg. annual rise in health costs: 1.6% 8 6 4 Overall inflation 2 0 \u201960 \u201970 \u201980 \u201990 \u201900 \u201910 \u201915 And despite the subsidies, many people still can\u2019t afford health care. For some middle-class families who buy coverage on the exchanges, the cost of insurance and out-of-pocket expenses like co-pays and deductibles can add up to nearly a quarter of household income, according to the Urban Institute. It is no wonder then that nearly 80 percent of those who still do not have insurance say they cannot afford it. Mr. Obama proposes several fixes. He recommends that the government offer its own health insurance, a so-called public option, on the exchanges in some parts of the country. That could help make health care more affordable in rural areas and smaller cities where only two or three insurers sell coverage. Republicans and some moderate Democrats fear that this could be the first step to a single-payer health care system. But there might be more support for a policy that is intended strictly for people in places with few choices. Mrs. Clinton supports the public option and has even suggested that people between the ages of 55 and 64 be allowed to buy into Medicare, though she has not yet provided details of how that would work. Mr. Trump has said he wants universal health coverage, and has proposed tax deductions and allowing insurers to sell policies across state borders. Tax deductions would help some people but wouldn\u2019t be enough, experts say. And insurers can already expand into other states as long as they follow the laws and regulations of the states in which they want to do business. Care Still Isn\u2019t Cheap for Everyone Percent of income devoted to health care for singles and couples without children. Includes premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

This can be done at a modest cost paid for by slightly higher taxes, according to several experts. In addition, both federal and state governments ought to do more to educate people about the subsidies available to help them buy insurance. The system could also be made more efficient. The Affordable Care Act has pushed insurers, doctors and hospitals to focus on preventive care, as Mr. Obama notes in his article, and lawmakers can build on that progress. Congress, he added, should allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, an idea that could help lower costs but faces stiff opposition from Republicans and even some Democrats. Yet another way to reduce spending on drugs, experts say, is to set up a system under which government pays more for effective medicines than for comparable drugs with less impressive results. The Obama administration recently proposed experimentally testing these and other changes within Medicare. The pharmaceutical industry is resisting and has pressured legislators to do so, too. What Mr. Obama has done here is unusual \u2014 asking someone else to burnish a legacy of which he is personally proud. If the candidates (and Congress) pay attention, his request may also do a world of good for millions of Americans for whom decent health care remains out of reach.",

        "parsed_article": "In the short term, they might be right: In 2018 and 2020, Republican politics might return to an uneasy normalcy. But if Trump\u2019s working-class supporters were voting as much for the man as for his message, they were also clearly voting against a party leadership that pays them lip service while ignoring their concerns. Some of these concerns are rooted in racial anxiety, and an older generation\u2019s inevitable fear of change. But many of them are rooted in basic human vulnerability \u2014 a very personal exposure to stagnant wages, family breakdown, military quagmires (America\u2019s wars are disproportionately fought by volunteers from downscale Red America) and a social crisis of opioid abuse and suicide that hardly anyone in Washington or New York noticed until recently. These are problems that deserve a political response no matter what racial biases the people experiencing them may harbor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keep stringing these voters along with symbolism, and they will eventually seek another Trump. So what should the Republican Party offer them instead? The best answer is a conservative politics that stresses the national interest abroad and national solidarity at home. It should define America\u2019s overseas goals in more achievable terms than the Bush-era \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d or a Hillary Clinton-in-Libya liberal interventionism; promise support to workers buffeted by globalization; and explicitly weigh questions of community and solidarity when it sets tax rates or immigration levels. Begin with foreign policy, where one of Trump\u2019s more grotesque innovations has been his praise of Vladimir V. Putin, his nostalgia for Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. But Trump has put his finger on a real problem: The Republican Party since the Sept. 11 attacks has struggled to weigh the relative gravity of different threats, to devise a strategy that distinguishes between bad and worse (as our Cold War strategy generally did), to offer a vision that doesn\u2019t seem to promise escalation on every front simultaneously. To voters who watched their children bleed in Iraq and Afghanistan, or who have bled themselves, the party hasn\u2019t provided much reassurance that it has learned lessons from those conflicts. With the exception of Rand Paul and the partial exception of Ted Cruz, the consensus critique of President Obama from not-Trump Republicans often seemed to be that he should have kept more troops in Iraq and kept more troops in Afghanistan and sent more troops to Libya and intervened in Syria and sent more arms to Ukraine and expanded NATO\u2019s presence in the Baltics and been more willing to bomb Iran and \u2026 Some of these policy prescriptions are reasonable, but taken together they look like a road map for more quagmires, more Afghanistans and Iraqs. This is the landscape in which Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d language resonated. And the ease with which Trump crushed Jeb Bush, in particular, suggests that it will continue to resonate until Republican leaders become more selective in their hawkishness, more comfortable with five simple words: Invading Iraq was a mistake. THE same need to define the national interest applies to the immigration debate, where the leaders of both parties seem viscerally uncomfortable with the idea \u2014 common to not-notably-intolerant nations like Australia and Canada \u2014 that the United States should strongly favor high-skilled immigrants over low-skilled immigrants. Among libertarian-minded conservatives as well as liberals, it is an article of faith that skepticism about mass immigration is driven largely by racism, and Trump\u2019s campaign has powerfully reinforced this assumption. But when you dig into survey data, immigration skepticism seems to be rooted as much in concerns about how quickly immigrants assimilate, whether they rely on welfare programs and whether they compete for American jobs as it is in racial or cultural anxiety. Such concerns are reasonable. While less-educated immigrants are no less admirable and hard-working than those who have managed to acquire the skills most prized in our polarized labor market, there is clear evidence that they and their children need more of a helping hand from social programs, and that their descendants are more likely to assimilate downward when that help does not suffice. The United States is already unique among the world\u2019s affluent market democracies in our level of entrenched poverty. Since the New Deal era, we\u2019ve created a thicket of programs for the poor that are notorious for their complexity, their expense and sometimes their inadequacy. Both liberals and conservatives have recognized that our tools for fighting poverty are failing the poorest of the poor, and that our society could face a growing scourge of worklessness. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Given these problems, an immigration policy in the national interest should explicitly try to attract immigrants who will be in a strong position to provide for their families in a difficult economic environment. It should encourage a market in which employers have to compete more for less-skilled labor, to slow the alarming retreat from paying work among native-born working-class men. This doesn\u2019t require closing the door to legal status for the millions of illegal immigrants already here. But it requires a very different policy approach: Instead of \u201cGang of Eight\u201d-style bills that hide instant legalization and higher levels of low-skilled immigration under a fig leaf of border toughness, Republicans should make any path to permanent legal status conditional on steady year-over-year cuts in the pace of low-skilled immigration, both legal and illegal. THIS brings us to larger questions of domestic policy, where Trump has brought to the surface deep divisions between the party elite and its working-class voters on taxes and spending. There have always been rank-and-file Republicans who favor higher taxes on the rich, and though Trump\u2019s official tax plan cuts them drastically, he has shrewdly made populist noises about forcing Wall Street tycoons to pay their fair share. Nothing unites elite conservatives more than their support for bringing entitlement spending under control. But by frequently insisting that he\u2019d never cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, and basically endorsing universal health care, Trump has put himself on the side of millions of grass-roots Republicans. If Republicans are to address the anxieties of Trump\u2019s voters, they should be looking for ways to bridge these divides. On taxes, for example, the party would do well to focus on measures that raise working Americans\u2019 take-home pay \u2014 not down the road, but right now, in a clear and quantifiable way. There are various ways to accomplish this, such as payroll tax cuts, family-friendly tax reform, wage subsidies or a larger earned-income tax credit. Republicans like Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Paul D. Ryan have championed some of these ideas. But they have often played second fiddle to big upper-bracket tax cuts. So Republicans trying to demonstrate that they have learned something from the Trump trauma should consider embracing a new tax pledge. The party will still back tax cuts for the middle class and revenue-neutral tax reforms. But there should be no new income tax cuts for households earning $250,000 or more. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This self-denying ordinance will be difficult for supply-siders to bear, and it will have certain economic downsides; under the right circumstances tax cuts for the rich really do have virtues. For now, however, Republicans need to repair a breach of trust. Similarly, Republicans need to rethink how they talk about health care and retirement. The party has already moved away, wisely, from its Bush-era attempt at Social Security privatization, and figures like Speaker Ryan are always careful to stress that they\u2019re protecting entitlements for the long term, not just arbitrarily cutting them. But more can be done to reassure the voters who depend on Medicare and Social Security \u2014 and now Medicaid and Obamacare \u2014 that their interests will be protected when the programs are reformed. This might mean instituting a minimum Social Security benefit while curbing benefits for high earners, or using competition to curb cost growth in Medicare and Medicaid while also expanding coverage to include long-term care. It definitely means recognizing that Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion is here to stay, and reassuring voters that any reform of health care reform will maintain the coverage of working-class Americans who were previously slipping through cracks. And not only for the sake of staving off another Trumpening in 2020 or beyond. A politics that stresses national solidarity isn\u2019t just the best way to keep Trump voters from tearing down the party\u2019s tent. It\u2019s also the most plausible path up from white identity politics to a one-nation, pan-ethnic conservatism. A more nationalist politics is, in one sense, a more exclusive politics, as it is based on the premise that there is such a thing as an American national community, and that this community\u2019s interests at times must be placed ahead of humanity as a whole. But nationalism can also be inclusive, insofar as it emphasizes the interests that Americans of all classes and ethnic backgrounds share. Why should privileged Americans care more about the fate of children raised in low-income United States households than poorer children elsewhere in the world? Part of the reason is that all Americans live under the same government, and if its policies fail the most vulnerable among us, its very legitimacy is in question. Another part, however, is that as Americans we are \u2014 or ought to be \u2014 linked by bonds of affection and a sense of shared fate. If the Republican Party wants to offer this kind of unifying nationalism, it clearly needs to abandon Trump\u2019s explicit appeals to white identity. But that\u2019s just a baby step: The only way that Republicans can actually win more Hispanics or African-Americans is by expanding their party\u2019s vision of the American nation to fully include those voters and by persuading them that the party cares about their fate. In part, that\u2019s the work of public rhetoric: no laundry list of policy proposals can substitute for an eloquent narrative of inclusion.

        "parsed_article": "\u201cWhite Republican college graduates and white Republicans who do not have a degree generally agree on many political and policy issues,\u201d the Pew Research Center found in a March 2016 report. Nearly half of college-educated Republicans, men and women, believe immigrants \u201cburden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care,\u201d a view shared by 62 percent of non-college Republicans. A plurality of those with college educations, 38 percent, say that they would be more likely to vote for a candidate \u201cwho wants to deport all immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\u201d Half of those without degrees agree. A striking 64 percent of college-educated white Republicans support building a \u201cfence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d as do 75 percent of non-college Republicans. I asked pollsters and political scientists why Trump appeals to educated white men. Howard Rosenthal, a political scientist at N.Y.U., sent a thoughtful reply to my inquiry: The past 50 years have witnessed a very substantial redistribution from white males to minorities and women. I supported and now believe in the public policies that accomplished this redistribution. But redistribution it is. The adoption of redistributive policies favoring women and minorities has, in Rosenthal\u2019s unvarnished view, fundamentally changed the character of the political parties. \u201cThe Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton are engaged in identity politics. And the redistribution is not win-win,\u201d Rosenthal wrote, adding that identity politics is a matter of social justice that has had limited economic benefits for white males throughout the income distribution. So even if college-educated whites are doing relatively well economically, the redistributive policies espoused by Clinton and the Democratic Party \u2014 Obamacare, affirmative action, more progressive taxation and expanded social insurance policies \u2014 have led Rosenthal to conclude that \u201cin terms of pocketbook voting, I am not surprised that Trump draws support from many college educated white males.\u201d The meaning of a college degree, Rosenthal points out, has changed over the years: There has been a large expansion of the bottom tier, with relatively more students graduating from Cal State Hayward or Cal State Dominguez Hills than from Berkeley or UCLA. And those graduating from lower tier schools may not be doing all that well in the economy. Male college graduates who are struggling are more likely to join white working class men in the larger insurgency against globalization and free trade that is taking place here and all over Europe. A parallel reaction, often overlooked or disregarded by the media, academia and the left, can be found on other issues, especially immigration. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the number of immigrants to the United States has grown, from 9.6 million to 42.4 million between 1970 and 2014, 49 percent of whites and 58 percent of Republicans perceive these newcomers as \u201ca threat to American values,\u201d according to a 2013 Pew survey. A March PRRI survey report found that 47 percent of older whites \u2014 among whom Trump runs better than he does among younger whites \u2014 agreed that immigrants \u201crepresent a threat to American customs and values.\u201d On a separate front, between 1999 and 2015, the inflation-adjusted value of imported goods has grown from $1.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion. According to recent polls, majorities of Americans see the increase in imported goods as \u201ctaking away U.S. jobs.\u201d A May 16-19 ABC News/Washington Post survey found, for example, that 53 percent of respondents believe that \u201ctrade with other countries\u201d eliminates more jobs than it creates in the United States. Among whites, the percentage grows to 59 percent. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at N.Y.U., sent me an essay from The American Interest in which he argues that in order to understand the rise of nativist populists like Trump, especially among white men, both here and abroad, one must first look at the globalists, and at how their changing values may drive many of their fellow citizens to support right-wing political leaders. Globalists, including elites in the Democratic Party, support high levels of immigration and reductions in national sovereignty; they tend to see transnational entities such as the European Union as being morally superior to nation-states; and they vilify the nationalists and their patriotism as \u201cracism pure and simple.\u201d The global agenda presses a \u201cnormative threat\u201d button in the minds of those who are predisposed to authoritarianism, and these actions can drive status quo conservatives to join authoritarians in fighting back against the globalists and their universalistic projects. Haidt\u2019s use of the concept of \u201cnormative threat\u201d is helpful in exploring other challenges to traditional cultural norms, including male reaction to the nomination of a woman for president. There is a substantial body of research that suggests gender-based reasons why men \u2014 college-educated men included \u2014 lean toward Trump. Alice Eagly, a social psychologist at Northwestern, contends that gender-based group stereotypes remain a powerful force, particularly in terms of how people gauge the ability of women to handle different tasks.

View all New York Times newsletters. In a 2014 paper written with Anne Koenig, a social psychologist at the University of San Diego, Eagly reported that the jobs most commonly associated with men include business professional, politicians, C.E.O. and lawyer while the jobs most commonly associated with women included teacher, secretary, nurse and homemaker. These widely held group stereotypes incline voters \u201cto disqualify\u201d women seeking positions stereotypically held by men. Without referring to Clinton, Eagly and Koenig argue that the stereotype of women as belonging in the helping or communal professions has remained constant \u201cdespite massive change in women\u2019s roles in the 20th century.\u201d This is because most of the movement of women from homemaking to employment has put them in occupational roles that are perceived as not especially agentically demanding but highly communally demanding. Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to Catalyst, women currently make up 15.4 percent of C.E.O.s. The consequences, Eagly and Koenig write, are apparent in their employment in the expanding service, educational, and health care sectors of the economy. Specifically, the six most common occupations for women in the United States are secretary and administrative assistant; registered nurse; elementary and middle school teacher; cashier; nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides; and retail salespersons. Along related lines, Ann C. McGinley, a law professor at the University of Nevada, argued in a 2009 paper \u2014 \u201cHillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Obama: Performing Gender, Race, and Class on the Campaign Trail\u201d \u2014 that women\u2019s identities as aspiring political leaders continue to be problematic, and require women to negotiate a double bind: if they are too feminine, they are deemed incompetent. If they are too masculine, they are considered not likeable. An ABC News/Washington Post poll last month found that 75 percent of white men had a negative view of Clinton and 23 percent had a favorable view. In the case of college-educated white men, the combined May and June NBC News/Wall Street Journal surveys show a decisively unfavorable iew of Clinton (62-26). A number of pollsters pointed out to me that hostility to Clinton is more important than the appeal of Trump in the continuing support for Trump among white college men. \u201cHer negatives are awful,\u201d the Republican pollster Bill McInturff noted in an email. The paradox of Trump\u2019s support among educated white men is that even though a plurality told Pew that they will vote for Trump, NBC/WSJ poll data shows that a clear majority \u2014 58 percent \u2014 view Trump unfavorably. That is, they plan to vote for Trump without liking him. Bias against women in leadership roles often accompanies bias against racial and ethnic minorities and may contribute to the willingness of white men \u2014 both college and non-college \u2014 to accept flawed leadership from Trump rather than grant authority to women \u2014 or to African-Americans or Hispanics. Susan T. Fiske, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton, put it clearly: People are often biased against others outside of their own social group, showing prejudice (emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and discrimination (behavioral bias). In the past, people used to be more explicit with their biases, but during the 20th century, when it became less socially acceptable to exhibit bias, such things like prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination became more subtle (automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent). While politically speaking college men are keeping a relatively low profile this year and not broadcasting their views, there are hard-right conservative activists more than willing to grab center stage. In March, Kimberly Ross, a regular contributor to the conservative web site RedState.com, wrote: With Hillary, a kinder, gentler, let\u2019s-bring-everyone-to-the-fold schtick is dead on arrival, because it\u2019s so disingenuous, at least to us who don\u2019t subscribe to the gooey social justice warrior mentality. To Kimberly Ross and those who support her views, \u201cgooey social justice\u201d refers to the conjoined issues of race and gender. On these issues, Hillary Clinton and her progressive and liberal supporters have starkly different views from those of Donald Trump and his loyalists \u2014 to put it mildly. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The rage that this progressive perspective incites on the far right appears to animate, in varying degrees, the white men who support Trump. This anti-liberal rage was put on display in the extreme reaction to Hillary Clinton\u2019s public comments in the aftermath of the slaughter of five policemen in Dallas last week. Clinton told CNN on July 8, \u201cI will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families who fear every time their children go somewhere,\u201d adding, I\u2019m going to be talking to white people \u2014 I think we\u2019re the ones who have to have to start listening to the legitimate cries that are coming from our African-American fellow citizens. The same day, on NBC, Clinton told Lester Holt that Americans \u201chave to be honest, all of us, in facing implicit bias that all of us, unfortunately, may still have.\u201d Clinton continued along these lines Wednesday in a speech on race in Springfield, Ill.: We do need to listen to those who say \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable. To a Democrat, Clinton\u2019s words sound reassuring and healing. Conservatives hear her words very differently: \u201cHillary Clinton Blames Whites, Cops for Deaths of Young Black Men\u201d declared the July 8 headline on Breitbart.com. Jim Hoft, writing on July 10 at thegatewaypundit.com,was even more explicit: \u201cHillary Clinton Calls for White People to Change after 5 White Cops Gunned Down in Dallas.\u201d The critique of Clinton\u2019s problems with white men is not limited to the right. In October 2015, Josh Kraushaar wrote in The Atlantic: At some point, her campaign will have to grapple with why her support has cratered so badly among men. Did the campaign\u2019s initial plan to play up Clinton\u2019s soft, grandmotherly persona backfire at a time of mounting global turmoil? Is it a consequence of the campaign\u2019s unabashedly liberal turn on social issues, particularly on abortion rights, immigration, and gun control? Or is it simply a product of her overall low approval numbers, dampened by the ongoing developments about her handling of classified email at the State Department? In fact, Clinton may not have to grapple with the cratering of white male support just as long as Trump craters even more deeply among women and minorities. Women, after all, make up 53 percent of voters. But the depth of his support among college men signals the continuing volatility and disquiet of the electorate.",

I don\u2019t want to touch any citizen\u2019s Second Amendment rights, but the notion that we can\u2019t restrict military weapons that are increasingly being used in mass murders defies common sense \u2014 yet it can\u2019t be fixed as long as today\u2019s G.O.P. controls any branch of government. If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we can borrow $100 billion at close to zero interest for a national infrastructure rebuild to deal with some of the nation\u2019s shameful deferred maintenance of roads, bridges, airports and rails and its inadequate bandwidth, and create more blue-collar jobs that would stimulate growth. If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we will have a chance to put in place a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would stimulate more clean energy production and allow us to reduce both corporate taxes and personal income taxes, which would also help spur growth. If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we can fix whatever needs fixing with Obamacare, without having to junk the whole thing. Right now we have the worst of all worlds: The G.O.P. will not participate in any improvements to Obamacare nor has it offered a credible alternative. At the same time, if Clinton crushes Trump in November, the message will be sent by the American people that the game he played to become the Republican nominee \u2014 through mainstreaming bigotry; name-calling; insulting women, the handicapped, Latinos and Muslims; retweeting posts by hate groups; ignorance of the Constitution; and a willingness to lie and make stuff up with an ease and regularity never seen before at the presidential campaign level \u2014 should never be tried by anyone again. The voters\u2019 message, \u201cGo away,\u201d would be deafening. Finally, if Trump presides over a devastating Republican defeat across all branches of government, the G.O.P. will be forced to do what it has needed to do for a long time: take a time out in the corner. In that corner Republicans could pull out a blank sheet of paper and on one side define the biggest forces shaping the world today \u2014 and the challenges and opportunities they pose to America \u2014 and on the other side define conservative, market-based policies to address them. Photo Our country needs a healthy center-right party that can compete with a healthy center-left party. Right now, the G.O.P. is not a healthy center-right party. It is a mishmash of religious conservatives; angry white males who fear they are becoming a minority in their own country and hate trade; gun-control opponents; pro-lifers; anti-regulation and free-market small-business owners; and pro- and anti-free trade entrepreneurs.

But as that faded away it has been held together only by renting itself out to whoever could energize its base and keep it in power \u2014 Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, the Tea Party, the National Rifle Association. But at its core there was no real common denominator, no take on the world, no real conservative framework. The party grew into a messy, untended garden, and Donald Trump was like an invasive species that finally just took over the whole thing. Party leaders can all still call themselves Republicans. They can even hold a convention with a lot of G.O.P. elephant balloons. But the truth is, the party\u2019s over. Thoughtful Republicans have started to admit that. John Boehner gave up being speaker of the House because he knew that his caucus had become a madhouse, incapable of governing. A Clinton sweep in November would force more Republicans to start rebuilding a center-right party ready to govern and compromise. And a Clinton sweep would also mean Hillary could govern from the place where her true political soul resides \u2014 the center-left, not the far left. I make no predictions about who will win in November. But I sure know what I\u2019m praying for \u2014 and why.",

That might well have raised the temperature, not lowered it. Besides which, he hasn\u2019t discussed only discrimination. In Warsaw last week, when he expressed concern about the deaths of Sterling and Castile, he repeatedly mentioned the fine work of most police officers and the need to keep them safe. \u201cWhen people say black lives matter, that doesn\u2019t mean blue lives don\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, and this was before the Dallas carnage. His critics edit that out. They point to data like a Gallup poll from three months ago in which 35 percent of Americans said that they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about race relations. That number had doubled over the prior two years, a period coinciding with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

There\u2019s no contest. It\u2019s also possible that the election of the first black president gave some wishful Americans hope of suddenly perfect racial harmony and that the current bitterness grew in the gap between expectations and reality. That\u2019s not Obama\u2019s fault.

If he were an \u201caggrieved black activist,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t have used his graduation speech at Howard University in May to caution its black students not to ignore enormous racial progress and to assure them that if they could choose a time to be \u201cyoung, gifted and black in America, you\u2019d choose right now.\u201d If he were an \u201caggrieved black activist,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t have pulled off what he did in Dallas on Tuesday, a nuanced balancing act in an era without much nuance or balance. Just before his speech, Michelle Obama bent toward and reached out to the person seated to her right. That tender image \u2014 of her hand on George W.

The Republican presidential candidate who had a \u201cuniversity\u201d that wrung thousands of dollars out of credulous students with get-rich-quick promises, which was linked to an extremely shady seminar program that plagiarized course materials from an old real estate manual.

Who Trump slammed as a biased \u201cMexican,\u201d triggering a Paul Ryan distancing of epic proportions. Every problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes attached to a reminder that the alternative is the businessman with a terrible business record and attraction to murderous tyrants. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything that she could do that would make her look like the worse option in this particular contest. It\u2019s a lucky candidate who gets the chance to divert attention from her problems by giving a speech in the city where her opponent bankrupted several casinos and dodged the bills of a long line of small businesses. But nobody wants to be remembering 2016 as the year America elected its first woman president by default. Since at least she didn\u2019t get indicted. Clinton can spend the next four months listing all the ways Trump would be worse. Or she can use her intelligence, experience and fortitude to turn her story around.

Her strategists aren\u2019t stupid; they know that the chances of making unwelcome news at these encounters are high. They\u2019ll keep dodging them if they simply want to make sure she can stagger across the finish line this fall. The only argument on the other side is that she\u2019s prepared to demonstrate she\u2019s not just better than Trump; she\u2019s better than her own current background noise. \u25a0 Take a hard position, just because. Clinton has been rolling out some smart, progressive and well thought out proposals on issues like student loans. But it doesn\u2019t exactly require a profile in courage to be against college debt.

As Mr. Mishel says, there have been \u201cmany other intentional policies\u201d driving wages down even as top incomes soar: union-bashing, the failure to raise the minimum wage with inflation, austerity, financial deregulation, the tax-cut obsession. And Mr. Trump buys fully into the ideology that has driven these wage-destroying policies. In fact, even as he tried to pose as a populist he repeated the same falsehoods usually used to justify anti-worker policies. We are, he declared, \u201cone of the highest taxed nations in the world.\u201d Actually, among 34 advanced countries, we\u2019re No. 31. And, regulations are \u201can even greater impediment\u201d to our competitiveness than taxes: Actually, we\u2019re far less regulated than, say, Germany, which runs a gigantic trade surplus. As Mr. Mishel wrote, \u201cif is he so keen to help working people, why does he then steer the discussion back toward the traditional corporate agenda of tax cuts for corporations and the rich?\u201d I think we know the answer. But never mind Mr. Trump\u2019s motivations. What\u2019s important is that voters not mistake tough talk on trade for a pro-worker agenda. No matter what we do on trade, America is going to be mainly a service economy for the foreseeable future. If we want to be a middle-class nation, we need policies that give service-sector workers the essentials of a middle-class life. This means guaranteed health insurance \u2014 Obamacare brought insurance to 20 million Americans, but Republicans want to repeal it and also take Medicare away from millions. It means the right of workers to organize and bargain for better wages \u2014 which all Republicans oppose. It means adequate support in retirement from Social Security \u2014 which Democrats want to expand, but Republicans want to cut and privatize. Is Mr. Trump for any of these things? Not as far as anyone can tell. And it should go without saying that a populist agenda won\u2019t be possible if we\u2019re also pushing through a Trump-style tax plan, which would offer the top 1 percent huge tax cuts and add trillions to the national debt. Sorry, but adding a bit of China-bashing to a fundamentally anti-labor agenda does no more to make you a friend of workers than eating a taco bowl does to make you a friend of Latinos.",

A lot of our allies do take advantage of us. Our trade deals have left swaths of America devastated. And it was a positive move to propose a meeting with the N.R.A. on gun control for people on the terrorist watch list.

As so often happens at conferences, however, what really got me thinking was a question during coffee break: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk more about horizontal inequality?\u201d What? Horizontal inequality is the term of art for inequality measured, not between individuals, but between racially or culturally defined groups. (Of course, race itself is mainly a cultural construct rather than a fact of nature \u2014 Americans of Italian or even Irish extraction weren\u2019t always considered white.) And it struck me that horizontal thinking is what you need to understand what went down in both parties\u2019 nominating seasons: It\u2019s what led to Donald Trump, and also why Hillary Clinton beat back Bernie Sanders. And like it or not, horizontal inequality, racial inequality above all, will define the general election. You can argue that it shouldn\u2019t be that way. One way to think about the Sanders campaign is that it was based on the premise that if only progressives were to make a clear enough case about the evils of inequality among individuals, they could win over the whole working class, regardless of race. In one interview Mr. Sanders declared that if the media was doing its job, Republicans would be a fringe party receiving only 5 or 10 percent of the vote. But that\u2019s a pipe dream. Defining oneself at least in part by membership in a group is part of human nature. Even if you try to step away from such definitions, other people won\u2019t. A rueful old line from my own heritage says that if you should happen to forget that you\u2019re Jewish, someone will remind you: a truth reconfirmed by the upsurge in vocal anti-Semitism unleashed by the Trump phenomenon.

        "parsed_article": "When I last wrote about this development, I speculated that it originated with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the justice most likely to be struggling with the issue and looking for a way out of having to decide it. On reflection, I now agree with smart observers of the court, including Professors Richard C. Schragger and Micah Schwartzman of the University of Virginia Law School and Professor Nelson Tebbe of Brooklyn Law School that Justice Stephen G. Breyer is the more likely instigator. He has spent two decades on the court trying to craft compromises that might bring Justice Kennedy around. He has failed as often as not, but he has had some successes, too, and Justice Breyer is the eternal optimist, ever hopeful that logic can bring together people of good will but divergent views. In any event, whoever on the court came up with the \u201cwhy can\u2019t we all get along\u201d idea may have met his or her match in the determination of the religious nonprofits to treat any compromise as unacceptable surrender. The Obama administration readily agreed that the court\u2019s proposal of inferential notification could work. And at first it appeared that the nonprofits would go along as well. \u201cSisters Say \u2018Yes\u2019 to Scotus Solution,\u201d proclaimed the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, lawyers for one of the plaintiffs, the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cWhen the court asked if there were other ways and if the Little Sisters would accept them, \u2018yes\u2019 was an easy and obvious answer,\u201d the Becket Fund\u2019s news release said. But nothing about this case is that easy or that obvious. The nonprofits\u2019 supplemental reply brief contained important qualifications. The brief made clear that the only acceptable arrangement would be \u201ca separate policy, with a separate enrollment process, a separate insurance card, and a separate payment source, and offered to individuals through a separate communication.\u201d Contraception coverage could be provided only \u201cpursuant to an individual contract between the insurance company and the plan beneficiaries [i.e., women], not as an automatic and unavoidable companion to petitioners\u2019 plans.\u201d To translate: There could be no automatic enrollment, and women would have to learn about the separate coverage, sign up and, separate insurance card in hand, shop for a doctor who accepted it. This is unacceptable to the Obama administration; as Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. made clear during the argument two months ago, the whole point was to make contraception coverage \u201cseamless\u201d and integrated with the rest of a woman\u2019s health care. So the court\u2019s reference last week to the \u201csubstantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties\u201d presents a puzzle. What\u2019s been clarified, it seems to me, is how far apart the two sides really are. It\u2019s highly likely that the four federal appeals courts that rejected the nonprofits\u2019 position in the first place will reiterate the conclusion that nothing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or the First Amendment requires the government to go through the contortions being demanded of it. Then the justices \u2014 however many there are at that point \u2014 will have decided what to do. To clear my head of the weeds in which this case has become entangled, I went back to take a fresh look at the appeals courts\u2019 opinions to see why judges across the political spectrum, including some of the judiciary\u2019s most liberal and most conservative members, found the religious nonprofits\u2019 position so lacking in merit. Perhaps the most illuminating is the opinion written by Judge Cornelia Pillard for a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Priests for Life v. United States Department of Health and Human Services. All the plaintiffs had to do to opt out of the obligation to cover contraception, Judge Pillard said, \u201cis express what they believe and seek what they want via a letter or two-page form.\u201d She continued, \u201cThat bit of paperwork is more straightforward and minimal than many that are staples of nonprofit organizations\u2019 compliance with law in the modern administrative state.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story A valuable part of this opinion was the context Judge Pillard provided for understanding who the plaintiffs were (most, although not all, Catholic-related) and how broadly their claim to a religious exemption swept: \u201cCatholic nonprofits have a long and broad history of service that goes far beyond worship or proselytizing. Nationally, Catholic hospitals, clinics, universities schools, and social service groups provide many services that are not inherently religious. Catholic-identified nonprofits employ and enroll as students millions of adults, not all of whom are coreligionists or share the Catholic Church\u2019s religious opposition to contraception.\u201d I quote this passage because there is a widespread misunderstanding that the case is about nuns, specifically the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order whose mission is to run nursing homes for the elderly poor. Commentary following last week\u2019s decision perpetuated this misunderstanding. \u201cSurely the Obama administration could find a way to provide contraception to women without involving a group of Catholic nuns,\u201d Ramesh Ponneru, a senior editor of National Review, wrote in a Bloomberg News post titled \u201cThe Culture War Obama Didn\u2019t Have to Wage.\u201d Richard W. Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, wrote on Scotusblog that the Obama administration had \u201caggressively and unlawfully overreached\u201d in its \u201cstrange insistence that a community of nuns who take vows of poverty and care for the elderly poor must serve as a vehicle for delivering free contraception to their employees.\u201d In a Wall Street Journal column titled \u201cBig Win for Little Sisters,\u201d William McGurn wrote that \u201cthough it was more a TKO than a straight-up ruling, the Little Sisters prevailed at the Supreme Court Monday in their fight against the Obamacare contraceptive mandate.\u201d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

By my count, the Little Sisters of the Poor (who, as I\u2019ve noted before, advertise themselves as equal-opportunity employers in the nursing home enterprise) are only one of 30 petitioners in the seven Supreme Court cases. The other 29 include Catholic and Baptist colleges, Catholic high schools, individual bishops, two chapters of Catholic Charities, other charities, and several individuals. Granted, it\u2019s more compelling to hear about the travails of the Little Sisters (who even merited a photo op with Pope Francis last September) than about the objection to contraception coverage held by the named plaintiff in the lead case, the Most Reverend David A. Zubik of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Opponents of the contraception mandate have been brilliant in positioning the case as being about nuns who have a name \u201cperfectly pitched to make liberals/progressives squirm,\u201d as Mona Charen wrote in National Review in a post that accused The Washington Post of burying the group\u2019s name in its story about the court\u2019s decision. A reader had to turn to the jump, Ms. Charen complained, and \u201cread down another five paragraphs to learn this is the case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor.\u201d Well, yes, and 29 other plaintiffs. So pervasive has the administration-versus-nuns narrative been that it\u2019s hard to believe that it has not at least subliminally played on the instincts and helped to shape the views of some members of the Supreme Court. Now that the cases are most likely back to square one, it\u2019s time for the administration and its supporters to recapture the narrative and make clear to a confused public that this is not a case about nuns. It\u2019s a case about women who should not, by reason of their particular employment, have to forfeit the right to comprehensive health care that the law makes available to other women in the work force. Wishful thinking, perhaps, but an urgent task.",

Let\u2019s start with drug companies charging record-breaking prices and hospitals leveraging dominant market positions for higher rates.

        "parsed_article": "We can see this in our own history. The middle-class society that baby boomers like me grew up in didn\u2019t happen by accident; it was created by the New Deal, which engineered what economists call the \u201cGreat Compression,\u201d a sharp reduction in income gaps. On one side, pro-labor policies led to a striking expansion of unions, which, along with the establishment of a fairly high minimum wage, helped raise wages, especially at the bottom. On the other side, taxes on the wealthy went up sharply, while major programs like Social Security aided working families. We can also see this in cross-country comparisons. Among advanced countries, the U.S. has the highest level of inequality, Denmark the lowest. How does Denmark do it? Partly with higher taxes and bigger social programs, but it starts with lower inequality in market incomes, thanks in large part to high minimum wages and a labor movement representing two-thirds of workers. Now, America isn\u2019t about to become Denmark, and Mr. Obama, facing relentless opposition in Congress, has never been in a position to repeat the New Deal. (Even F.D.R. made limited headway against inequality until World War II gave the government unusual influence over the economy.) But more has happened than you might think.

That makes it an important redistributionist policy \u2014 the biggest such policy since the 1960s. And between those extra Obamacare taxes and the expiration of the high-end Bush tax cuts made possible by Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election, the average federal tax rate on the top 1 percent has risen quite a lot. In fact, it\u2019s roughly back to what it was in 1979, pre-Ronald Reagan, something nobody seems to know. What about predistribution? Well, why is Mr. Trump, like everyone in the G.O.P., so eager to repeal financial reform? Because despite what you may have heard about its ineffectuality, Dodd-Frank actually has put a substantial crimp in the ability of Wall Street to make money hand over fist. It doesn\u2019t go far enough, but it\u2019s significant enough to have bankers howling, which is a good sign. And while the move on overtime comes late in the game, it\u2019s a pretty big deal, and could be the beginning of much broader action. Again, nothing Mr. Obama has done will put more than a modest dent in American inequality. But his actions aren\u2019t trivial, either. And even these medium-size steps put the lie to the pessimism and fatalism one hears all too often on this subject. No, America isn\u2019t an oligarchy in which both parties reliably serve the interests of the economic elite. Money talks on both sides of the aisle, but the influence of big donors hasn\u2019t prevented the current president from doing a substantial amount to narrow income gaps \u2014 and he would have done much more if he\u2019d faced less opposition in Congress.

        "parsed_article": "But the core reason for the disconnect between the nation\u2019s pretty-good condition and the gloomy conventional wisdom is that optimism itself has stopped being respectable. Pessimism is now the mainstream, with optimists viewed as Pollyannas. If you don\u2019t think everything is awful, you don\u2019t understand the situation! Objectively, the glass looks significantly more than half full. Job growth has been strong for five years, with unemployment now below where it was for most of the 1990s, a period some extol as the \u201cgood old days.\u201d The American economy is No. 1 by a huge margin, larger than Nos. 2 and 3 (China and Japan) combined. Americans are seven times as productive, per capita, as Chinese citizens. The dollar is the currency the world craves \u2014 which means other countries perceive America\u2019s long-term prospects as very good. Pollution, discrimination, crime and most diseases are in an extended decline; living standards, longevity and education levels continue to rise. The American military is not only the world\u2019s strongest, it is the strongest ever. The United States leads the world in science and engineering, in business innovation, in every aspect of creativity, including the arts. Terrorism is a serious concern, but in the last 15 years, even taking into account Sept. 11, an American is five times more likely to be hit by lightning than to be killed by a terrorist. Is the middle class in dire straits, as Mr. Sanders contends? Yes, inflation-adjusted middle-class household income peaked in 1998 and has dropped slightly since. But during the same period, federal income taxes on the middle class went down, while benefits went up. Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution has shown that when lower taxes and higher benefits are factored in, middle-class buying power has risen 36 percent in the current generation. Is American manufacturing in free fall, as Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump assert? Figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show industrial output a tad below an all-time record level, while nearly double the output of the Reagan presidency, another supposed golden age. It\u2019s just that advancing technology allows more manufacturing with fewer workers \u2014 a change unrelated to foreign competition. Manufacturing jobs described by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders as \u201clost\u201d to China cannot be found there, or anywhere. As Charles Kenny of the nonpartisan Center for Global Development has shown, technology is causing factory-floor employment to diminish worldwide, even as loading docks hum with activity. This transition is jarring to say the least \u2014 but it was always inevitable. The evolution of the heavy-manufacturing sector away from workers and toward machines will not stop, even if international trade is cut off completely. A century ago, most Americans worked in agriculture: Today hardly any do, and we\u2019re all better off, including farmers. That manual labor, farm or factory, has given way to 60 percent of Americans employed in white-collar circumstances is the important story in the long term. But nothing is achieved by moaning about the past. The challenge is to create even more white-collar opportunities. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though candidates on the right are full of fire and brimstone this year, the trend away from optimism is most pronounced among liberals. A century ago Progressives were the optimists, believing society could be improved, while conservatism saw the end-times approaching. Today progressive thought embraces Judgment Day, too. Climate change, inequality and racial tension are viewed not as the next round of problems to be solved, but as proof that the United States is horrible. And yet developing the postindustrial economy \u2014 while addressing issues such as inequality, greenhouse emissions and the condition of public schools \u2014 will require optimism. Pessimists think in terms of rear-guard actions to turn back the clock. Optimists understand that where the nation has faults, it\u2019s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. That\u2019s why the lack of progressive optimism is so keenly felt. In recent decades, progressives drank too deeply of instant-doomsday claims. If their predictions had come true, today petroleum would be exhausted, huge numbers of major animal species would be extinct, crop failures would be causing mass starvation, developing-world poverty would be getting worse instead of declining fast. (In 1990, 37 percent of humanity lived in what the World Bank defines as extreme poverty; today it\u2019s 10 percent.)

The lack of optimism in contemporary liberal and centrist thinking opens the door to Trump-style demagogy, since if the country really is going to hell, we do indeed need walls. And because optimism has lost its standing in American public opinion, past reforms \u2014 among them environmental protection, anti-discrimination initiatives, income security for seniors, auto and aviation safety, interconnected global economics, improved policing and yes, Obamacare \u2014 don\u2019t get credit for the good they have accomplished. In almost every case, reform has made America a better place, with fewer unintended consequences and lower transaction costs than expected. This is the strongest argument for the next round of reforms. The argument is better made in positive terms \u2014 which is why we need a revival of optimism. Recently Warren Buffett said that because of the \u201cnegative drumbeat\u201d of politics, \u201cmany Americans now believe their children will not live as well as they themselves do. That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.\u201d This was not Nebraska folk wisdom; rather, it\u2019s sophisticated analysis. The optimistic view is that it\u2019s still morning in America, and if we fix what\u2019s wrong, the best is yet to come. Such can-do, better-future thinking needs to make an appearance in the 2016 presidential campaign.",

        "parsed_article": "Even before the Trump-focused blame game started, Chief Justice Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag. In a rambling speech on the Senate floor last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, defended the Republican refusal to move forward with President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the Supreme Court\u2019s vacant seat. Playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s unexpected death, to the effect that the Senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, Senator Grassley said it was the Roberts court itself that was political. \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d he said, and then offered this observation: Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the justices appointed by Republicans often don\u2019t vote in a way that advances conservative policy. In other words, could it be that the problem with Chief Justice Roberts is that he isn\u2019t sufficiently political in the right direction? That was certainly the message Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent last month when called the chief justice \u201cthe tip of the spear in playing politics.\u201d In remarks at the Heritage Foundation, he explained: \u201cChief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote Obamacare twice. What we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d (By \u201ctwice,\u201d Governor Abbott was referring to the chief justice\u2019s majority opinion last year in King v. Burwell, which saved the statute from a contorted reading that would have stripped the federal government of the ability to set up insurance exchanges.) In trying to understand how one of the most conservative members of the most conservative court in decades has come to be viewed by fellow conservatives as an enemy of the people, several possible explanations come to mind. Derangement may be one. A mind-clouding obsession with the Affordable Care Act is another.

The scapegoating of Chief Justice Roberts is the clearest demonstration yet of a profound shift in the political polarity of judicial activism. For decades, conservative politicians railed against the \u201cjudicial activism\u201d of judges who overturned democratically enacted legislation, accusing such judges of seeking to use the power of the courts to impose their own political and social agendas. It was one of the easiest ways to score political points. Now it\u2019s judges who decline to strike down laws who stand accused of being political. Not so long ago, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d was a conservative goal against which judicial performance was measured. Now it\u2019s an epithet hurled at, of all people, Chief Justice Roberts, whose opinion four years ago gutting the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on the basis of a newly manufactured theory of federalism was undoubtedly one of the most activist of all recent Supreme Court decisions. That was the good kind of activism, it seems. Nothing political there. It\u2019s judicial restraint that\u2019s political. Are conservatives at all abashed at taking the vocabulary they grew up with and flipping it so openly? I see little sign of that, but I do think the energy behind the blockade of the Garland nomination is fueled by anxiety not only about what a more liberal court might do but in equal measure by what a judicially restrained court would not do. The fear of judicial restraint runs deep. Ilya Shapiro, the Cato Institute scholar who blamed John Roberts for Donald Trump, expressed it vividly. Lamenting the failure of the attack on the Affordable Care Act, he wrote, seemingly without irony: \u201cConstitutional conservatism simply couldn\u2019t survive judicial conservatism.\u201d",

It was remarkable to see the real Boehner and the real Obama acting like best buddies in the White House movie theater. Boehner even tells Obama that he finally got a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2014 only it was on a Chevy Tahoe, not the one they tried to negotiate on the economy. I watched that video with Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d and he had the exact same reaction I had: \u201cWhere was that brotherly love when America needed it\u201d for a real grand bargain? That scene plucked the deepest emotional chord in the country today: The nonstop fighting between our two political parties has left many Americans feeling like the children of two permanently divorcing parents. The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again.

There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008.

There was no @POTUS Twitter account, no Facebook Live, no Snapchat. There was also no real evidence that, outside of the traditional Washington joke dinners, being funny could help a policy be taken seriously. A turning point came after a somewhat rocky fall of 2013. That was when, as the president later described it in his 2014 correspondents\u2019 dinner speech: \u201cWe rolled out HealthCare.gov. That could have gone better.\u201d By March 2014, the health care exchanges were finally working, but most young people didn\u2019t seem to know that. Not enough of them were signing up. One solution, at least in part, was for President Obama to plug the site on the comedian Zach Galifianakis\u2019s online talk show \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d The commander in chief sat between two ferns and listened as the comedian asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be the last black president?\u201d before they got around to talking health care. The day the \u201cFerns\u201d video appeared online it was viewed by 11 million people, and traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked 40 percent. Of course that video isn\u2019t the only reason the administration can now report that 20 million people are enrolled in insurance through the Affordable Care Act. But it certainly helped get the word out. Since then, the president has appeared on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast, guest-hosted a segment on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and driven across the South Lawn of the White House with Jerry Seinfeld in a \u201963 Corvette. Of course, his most frequent target has been himself. He\u2019s made fun of everything from his hair going gray to his approval ratings going down. (This year they\u2019re going up, presenting an added challenge for the writers.) He\u2019s told jokes that set the tone for the year ahead. (2015: \u201cMy advisers asked me, \u2018Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.\u2019 \u201d) On occasions, he\u2019s used his comedic sensibility to tell some inconvenient political truths. (2013: Republicans agree that \u201cthey need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with.\u201d) There are some topics no president, even a genuinely funny one, can joke about. National security is off limits. So are all but the gentlest mentions of the first family. Then there was the meeting in 2013 when, sitting on the surprisingly comfortable brown couches in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriters suggested he talk about Republican senators in the style of Alicia Silverstone\u2019s character from \u201cClueless.\u201d Something like: \u201cSo then Mitch was talking with John who was talking with Lindsey who said that Rand and Ted were, like, talking?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis might be funny \u2026 if a professional comedian did it,\u201d the president said. We moved on. Another joke he rejected involved the District of Columbia decriminalizing marijuana, a Rand Paul filibuster and a congressional debate on \u201cwhether or not the Taco Bell is still open.\u201d He let us pitch him on it, but in the end it proved too clunky and complicated.

For weeks, writers in and outside the White House have submitted hundreds of jokes, and only a handful of my former colleagues know which 35 or 40 will make the final cut. A safe bet, however, is that at least a few of the president\u2019s one-liners will look back on the last eight years. He\u2019ll have plenty of material to work with \u2014 an economic recovery, Obamacare, rescuing the auto industry. It\u2019s unlikely \u201cstarring in viral videos\u201d will be high on the legacy list. But I do think that presidential comedy has played a role in this chapter in American history. The bully pulpit has splintered. It\u2019s become harder than ever to get people\u2019s attention. And the White House has recognized what class clowns have known all along. Being funny helps.",

        "parsed_article": "Second, their ambitions have demographic momentum on their side. The leftward, ever leftward impulse is concentrated among the party\u2019s younger constituents, with whom Sanders has rolled up ridiculous margins. So there\u2019s every reason to expect that a future left-wing insurgency could surpass his success even as he surpassed Bradley\u2019s and Dean\u2019s. Especially since Sanders was in many ways a non-ideal standard-bearer for a left-wing youth movement. He had his own past deviations (on guns and immigration) from the present liberal line, he struggled to win over African-American and Hispanic voters even though many of them sympathize with his economic vision, he seemed like too much of a long shot to win endorsements from the party\u2019s most liberal interest groups, and his obvious lack of interest in foreign policy prevented him from fully exploiting his opponent\u2019s major weakness. Elizabeth Warren, to pick one example, would have had fewer of these problems if she\u2019d decided to run, and given how well Sanders has done it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that Warren could have actually defeated Clinton. Now that it\u2019s clear that the opening is there, a candidate of full-spectrum progressivism could plausibly enter the next contested Democratic primary as a favorite. The interesting question, then, is how that candidate will deal with the real-world constraints that seem (or seemed) to limit progressivism\u2019s ambitions. One answer, Bernie Sanders\u2019s answer, was to promise the thing that every major Democratic politician since Walter Mondale has abjured: major tax increases, not only on the rich (who would be taxed at a rate upward of 70 percent under his plans), but on everybody, middle class and working class and upper middle class alike. This promise had the virtue of solving, at least on paper, the problem of how you pay for a welfare state even larger than the one we currently can\u2019t quite afford: just tax, tax and tax some more. But it had the disadvantage of being an extremely hard sell politically beyond Sanders\u2019s core enthusiasts. Such an agenda wouldn\u2019t just be unpopular with the party\u2019s donor class (though it would); it would threaten the stability of the larger Democratic coalition, which depends heavily on middle- and upper-middle-class support and whose leaders have repeatedly backed away from middle-class tax increases lest they give Republicans an opening. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Obama approach, and now the Hillary Clinton approach, of gently squeezing the 1 percent has become the consensus Democratic position for a reason: It\u2019s very popular with voters (including many Trump-voting Republicans). Whereas Sanders-style tax increases probably wouldn\u2019t even be popular with his own youth army in a few years, once their incomes had ticked up a bit. Given all of this, the progressivism of the near future might end up forgoing tax increases on that scale and embracing a kind of \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter\u201d liberalism instead. Progressives could follow the example of Republican supply-siders, by promising that government spending would pay for itself in huge, soaring economic growth and the higher tax receipts that follow. Or they could take the view that today\u2019s low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment is the new normal, that global instability will make the dollar a safe-as-houses investment no matter how large our structural deficits become, and that in this environment borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending is actually the prudent and sensible thing to do.

(For the record: I think both views are wrong, but after seven years in which the markets have stubbornly refused to panic over Washington\u2019s deficit follies, the second view seems less crazy than it once did.) Swinging in a deficits-don\u2019t-matter direction would alienate at least some of liberalism\u2019s leading economists and wonks. There was a huge outcry from that cohort when the Sanders campaign pointed to a wildly implausible estimate of his agenda\u2019s likely growth effects. It\u2019s less clear, though, how deeply it would alienate the party\u2019s donor base. (Are Wall Street or Silicon Valley Democrats all deep-dyed Simpson-Bowles supporters, or just deficit hawks of convenience like most people?) And it\u2019s doubtful that it would alienate the party\u2019s voters in the slightest. Which leaves this question for Bernie Sanders\u2019s would-be successors to consider, as they contemplate how to pitch an expensive agenda to a tax-sensitive party and country: How many divisions have the wonks?",

Can Donald Trump really win his party\u2019s nomination? (Yes.) Can Bernie Sanders? (No.) But the primaries aren\u2019t the only things being polled; we\u2019re still getting updates on President Obama\u2019s overall approval. And something striking has happened on that front. At the end of 2015 Mr. Obama was still underwater, with significantly more Americans disapproving than approving. Since then, however, his approval has risen sharply while disapproval has plunged. He\u2019s still only in modestly positive territory, but the net movement in polling averages has been about 11 percentage points, which is a lot. What\u2019s going on? Well, one answer is that voters have lately been given a taste of what really bad leaders look like. But I\u2019d like to think that the public is also starting to realize just how successful the Obama administration has been in addressing America\u2019s problems. And there are lessons from that success for those willing to learn. I know that it\u2019s hard for many people on both sides to wrap their minds around the notion of Obama-as-success. On the left, those caught up in the enthusiasms of 2008 feel let down by the prosaic reality of governing in a deeply polarized political system.

Was the purpose to present this as a difficult but ultimately positive development? The comments smacked of petulance and privilege. No member of an American minority group \u2014 whether ethnic, racial, queer-identified, immigrant, refugee or poor \u2014 would (or should) assume the luxury of uttering such a imbecilic phrase, filled with lust for doom. But I don\u2019t doubt that she has met \u201csome people\u201d with a Bernie-or-bust, scorched-earth electoral portentousness. As The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, \u201cA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates one third of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters cannot see themselves voting for Hillary Clinton in November.\u201d Be absolutely clear: While there are meaningful differences between Clinton and Sanders, either would be a far better choice for president than any of the remaining Republican contenders, especially the demagogic real estate developer. Assisting or allowing his ascendance by electoral abstinence in order to force a \u201crevolution\u201d is heretical. This position is dangerous, shortsighted and self-immolating. If Sanders wins the nomination, liberals should rally round him. Conversely, if Clinton does, they should rally round her. This is not a game. The presidency, particularly the next one, matters, and elections can be decided by relatively small margins. No president has won the popular vote by more than 10 percentage points since Ronald Reagan in 1984. When Al Gore ran against George W. Bush in 2000, some claimed that a vote for Gore was almost the same as a vote for Bush and encouraged people to cast protest votes for Ralph Nader. Sarandon supported Nader during that election. Bush became president, and what did we get? Two incredibly young, incredibly conservative justices, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., who will be on the court for decades, and two wars \u2014 in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2014 that, together, lasted over a decade. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to setting the tone and direction of the country, the president has some constitutional duties that are profound and consequential. They include being commander in chief, making treaties and appointing judges, including, most importantly, justices to the Supreme Court. Bush demonstrated the consequences of that. The real estate developer is now talking carelessly about promoting nuclear proliferation and torture (then there\u2019s Ted Cruz\u2019s talk of carpet bombing and glowing sand). And, there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Not only that, but as of Tuesday, there were also 84 federal judiciary vacancies with 49 pending nominees. The question of who makes those appointments matters immensely. As Jeffrey Toobin pointed out in The New Yorker in 2014: \u201cWhen Obama took office, Republican appointees controlled ten of the thirteen circuit courts of appeals; Democratic appointees now constitute a majority in nine circuits. Because federal judges have life tenure, nearly all of Obama\u2019s judges will continue serving well after he leaves office.\u201d Furthermore, Toobin laid out the diversity of the Obama transformation, writing: \u201cSheldon Goldman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a scholar of judicial appointments, said, \u2018The majority of Obama\u2019s appointments are women and nonwhite males.\u2019 Forty-two percent of his judgeships have gone to women. Twenty-two percent of George W. Bush\u2019s judges and 29 percent of Bill Clinton\u2019s were women. Thirty-six percent of President Obama\u2019s judges have been minorities, compared with 18 percent for Bush and 24 percent for Clinton.\u201d And beyond war and courts, there is the issue of inclusion. Take Obama\u2019s legacy on gay rights. He signed the bill repealing \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d And in 2012, Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage. Last year, Obama became the first president to say \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201ctransgender\u201d and \u201cbisexual\u201d in a State of the Union speech. Of more substance, according to the Gay & Lesbian Victory Institute: \u201cTo date, the Obama-Biden Administration has appointed more than 250 openly LGBT professionals to full-time and advisory positions in the executive branch; more than all known LGBT appointments of other presidential administrations combined.\u201d There is no reason to believe that this level of acceptance would continue under the real estate developer\u2019s administration. In fact, the Huffington Post Queer Voices editor at large Michelangelo Signorile wrote an article in February titled, \u201cNo, LGBT People Aren\u2019t Exempt from Donald Trump\u2019s Blatant Bigotry,\u201d responding to a trending idea that the Republican front-runner wasn\u2019t as bad for queer people as other Republican candidates: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely false \u2014 he\u2019s as extreme as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and will do nothing for LGBT rights \u2014 and it\u2019s time to disabuse the media and everyone else of this notion once and for all.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then there are all the other promises \u2014 threats? \u2014 the real estate developer has made. He has said he would deport all undocumented immigrants, build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, end birthright citizenship, dismantle Obamacare and replace it with something \u201cterrific\u201d (whatever that means), defund Planned Parenthood and temporarily ban most foreign Muslims from coming to this country, among other things. There is no true equivalency between either of the Democratic candidates and this man, and anyone who make such a claim is engaging in a repugnant, dishonorable scare tactic not worth our respect. It is unfortunate for Sanders, who seems infinitely sober and sensible, that some of his surrogates and supporters present themselves as absolutist and doctrinaire. As Sanders himself has said, \u201con her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day.\u201d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The New York Times Upshot even pointed out last May that Sanders and Clinton \u201cvoted the same way 93 percent of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate\u201d and in many of the cases in which Clinton voted differently from Sanders, \u201cshe voted with an overwhelming majority of her colleagues, including Republicans.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that those differing votes weren\u2019t significant. They were. As the Upshot put it, the 31 times they disagreed \u201chappened to be\u201d on some of \u201cthe biggest issues of the day, including measures on continuing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an immigration reform bill and bank bailouts during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201d And yet those differences hardly bring either candidate anywhere close to being as frightening as the specter of the real estate developer assuming the office of president of the United States.

But the American people can influence that course only if the Senate holds confirmation proceedings after the election season has ended. This should not be a controversial position. After all, both Republican and Democratic leaders, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have argued in the past that the Senate should defer consideration of life-tenured judges until after presidential election cycles. Throughout its history, the Senate has never confirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred this late in a term-limited president\u2019s time in office. Considering a nominee now \u2014 in the middle of the nastiest election campaign in recent memory \u2014 could damage the judicial confirmation process beyond repair. Having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for nearly four decades, I have witnessed firsthand the deterioration of the confirmation process. Neither party has clean hands on this front. The bitterness began when liberal senators attempted to savage the reputation of Judge Robert Bork in a campaign of character assassination led by Mr. Biden, who then was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. So unprecedented was this vicious effort to sully the nominee\u2019s good name that the Democratic strategy generated its own verb: to bork. Just a few years later, hostilities reached new heights when Democrats unapologetically attempted to bork Clarence Thomas\u2019s nomination. During George W.

This doesn\u2019t mean that Cruz\u2019s conservatism isn\u2019t sincere. But the fact that he seems so much like an actor hitting his marks fits with the story of how he became Mr. True Conservative Outsider in the first place. Basically, he spent years trying to make it in Washington on the insider\u2019s track, and hit a wall because too many of the insiders didn\u2019t like him \u2014 because his ambition was too naked, his climber\u2019s zeal too palpable. So he deliberately switched factions, turning the establishment\u2019s personal disdain into a political asset, and taking his Ivy League talents to the Tea Party instead. Then once installed as a leader of the counterestablishment, he walked a line that looks, again, far more calculated than most conviction politicians. While his fellow Tea Party senators, from Paul to Rubio to Utah\u2019s Mike Lee, built detailed policy portfolios that fit their interests and inclinations, Cruz never seemed to take a step on any contentious issue without gaming it out 17 moves ahead. His push for the Obamacare shutdown, and the bill of goods he sold the party\u2019s base, was a particularly remarkably exercise in self-serving political cynicism. But on many fronts \u2014 Edward Snowden, trade policy, immigration, the fate of Middle Eastern Christians \u2014 Cruz has proceeded with several fingers in the wind; every time the conservative mood has shifted even a little, he\u2019s shifted quickly too. The same pattern has prevailed in the presidential campaign, in his complicated relationship to Trump \u2014 obsequious at first, cynically imitative on issues where Trump\u2019s demagogy has worked, and finally self-righteous and dudgeon-filled now that the name-calling and scandal-mongering have been turned against his reputation and his family. Throughout this rise, Cruz has often seemed less like Goldwater than like American conservatism\u2019s own Kenneth Widmerpool, the most memorable character in the English novelist Anthony Powell\u2019s series, \u201cA Dance to the Music of Time.\u201d A dogged, charmless, unembarrassed striver, Widmerpool begins Powell\u2019s novels as a figure of mockery for his upper-class schoolmates.

But the American reader, less enamored of a fated aristocratic order, may find aspects of Widmerpool\u2019s character curiously sympathetic. And some of that strange sympathy could be extended to Cruz. Unloved, unattractive, a Simpsons-quoting nerd still chasing the teenage dream of world domination, the Texas senator has outworked, out-organized and outlasted the candidates who were supposed to beat him, from the blueblood to the jock. His cynicism can be repellent, his message discipline exhausting, and his Reagan-vintage policy proposals induce a mild despair. But in the drama of this insane campaign, he has actually earned his position, and if his doggedness wins the Republican nomination on the second ballot it will be one of the most fascinating triumphs in recent political history. Though it will also probably be short-lived. But if you think a little thing like losing a general election will dispose of Ted Cruz\u2019s ambitions, you don\u2019t know Ted Cruz.",

I will say, though, that I\u2019ve found conservative leaders on all sides of that question. What I always try to remind people is that the need for deep thinking and good ideas won\u2019t change, no matter what. Politics is like the weather; ideas are like the climate. Confusing them is a common but bad mistake. The struggle for ideas that bring freedom and opportunity to more people \u2014 especially people at the periphery of society \u2014 has to go on no matter what\u2019s going on in politics. Gail: Noble sentiments. Arthur: Thank you. I come from nobility \u2014 the House of Riffraff. Gail: There\u2019s a difference between the candidate you want and the one you would support if the other side was appalling. Let\u2019s take the all-critical issue of economics. I can imagine voting for someone whose spending priorities were different from mine. But I find it hard to imagine voting for anyone whose tax plan involved less burden for the wealthy. And don\u2019t try to tell me you\u2019re going to make it up by cutting fraud and waste. Arthur: Correct \u2014 simply cutting fraud and waste won\u2019t do it, although God knows there\u2019s a lot of waste. If conservatives want a smaller tax burden and lower deficits, the only answer is less spending. Long-term, reforming entitlements would have to play a central role. Yet the most likely Republican nominee at this point is actually opposed to conservative entitlement reform. The cognitive dissonance isn\u2019t just on the Republican side, however. Sanders proposes showering cash out of helicopters, and as far as I can tell, he is really only proposing higher taxes on the much-regretted billionaires. The truth is that middle-class taxes would have to rise under his spending scenarios. Gail: Let\u2019s talk about Hillary Clinton. I presume you\u2019re not thrilled with her sudden opposition to the Pacific trade agreement. Her explanation was pretty well-constructed, but I nevertheless acknowledge this was a political dive. However, looking at the big picture, her economic program is far, far and away the most responsible of all the remaining presidential candidates. Arthur: Clinton\u2019s convenient turnabout on trade was a total union cave \u2014 but no worse than what so many conservative Republicans did when they turned against trade promotion authority to spite President Obama, who admirably supported it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail: I love it when we come together in bipartisan agreement that everybody is in the tank. Arthur: Yeah, people sometimes say we have the \u201cstupid party\u201d and the \u201cevil party,\u201d but in times of crisis they can really come together to be both stupid and evil. As for Clinton\u2019s economic program, there aren\u2019t any shocking surprises: tax cuts for some working families, more spending on infrastructure and research, a higher minimum wage, and so on. Obviously I would do many things differently, like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to better assist childless workers instead of hiking the minimum wage. But that\u2019s no surprise. According to one analysis by the Tax Foundation, a D.C. research outfit, Clinton\u2019s tax plan could raise far less new revenue than projected because parts of it could drag down growth and depress economic output. And some proposals, like hiking capital gains taxes, would more likely bring about a surge in legal tax avoidance than some new, fair utopia. A bunch of these policies sound good to populist left-wing audiences, but would do real damage in practice. Gail: I don\u2019t want to sound like a total simpleton, but you could just change the rules and block that \u201clegal tax avoidance\u201d you\u2019re worrying over. Give me an example of something about her plan that really bothers you. Arthur: I wish her healthcare ideas were more centrist, or at least more original. As far as I can tell, her top three priorities are to 1) Keep Obamacare as is, 2) \u201cCrack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable,\u201d and 3) Protect abortion rights with hardly any restrictions whatsoever. This is all just so \u2014 kabuki progressive. She has to know that runaway costs are the result of a fundamental lack of market forces operating in health care, not just robber barons ripping us off. Scholars and others on both the left and the right have proposed lots of creative solutions that would better serve Clinton\u2019s own liberal goals than the status quo she insists on defending. Gail: Let me step back and defend your big three. The reason Clinton is having so much trouble with young voters is her almost pathological realism. On the health care front, I\u2019m sure she feels that the country would have done much better with something cleaner and more radical than Obamacare. Arthur: Hey, anything is cleaner than Obamacare. My backyard shed is cleaner than Obamacare. Gail: But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got and we\u2019re never going to get to start over again. She certainly doesn\u2019t want to keep it as is, and I think she\u2019d actually do a good job of improving it if she gets a slightly more rational Congress to work with. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Second, when it comes to cracking down on health costs, there\u2019s nothing that would deliver a bigger bang for the political effort than standing up to the pharmaceutical companies on drug prices. Arthur: My response here is as predictable as my dad\u2019s jokes: The problem is that cracking down on drug prices by fiat is a fantastic way to drive down innovation in biopharmaceuticals and other cutting-edge innovations that could save millions of lives. This may not make a great bumper sticker, but the way to build a better system for consumers is actually to expose them to prices and let them comparison shop, like we do in every other field. Government can help provide vulnerable people with the resources they need. But trying to shelter consumers from any awareness of real costs is exactly the thinking that made health care such a basket case industry to begin with. Gail: On your third point \u2014 I know we disagree on abortion rights and we will need to have that conversation at some point. But for now just let me say that for a lot of women in this country, that\u2019s far from a small issue. It\u2019s central to our individual rights. So I think that\u2019s a pretty fine trio of priorities. But what would you rather hear her say? Arthur: As a political matter, my advice to Clinton \u2014 and I know the Clinton campaign is stoked to hear the advice of the president of A.E.I. \u2014 is to avoid making a classic error. After eight years of relatively doctrinaire liberalism from the White House, the public is ready for a change. That\u2019s normal. But she is hearing from the loudest voices on the left during the primary that the desired change is an even bigger lurch leftward. She should resist and ramp up her willingness to borrow center-right ideas instead. That way, if she wins in November, she would have a much better chance to succeed. Gail: I agree with you about the desire for change, and that\u2019s a problem for her since she\u2019s basically been running as the heir to the Obama administration. But at bottom, if most Americans think about it, I believe they\u2019d say they like what the president has done over all. He made an imperfect but critical move toward universal health coverage. Bailed out the auto industry. Pursued a humanitarian but even-handed immigration policy. While it\u2019s easy for her opponents to argue that the economy should be doing better, it\u2019s puttering along pretty darned well considering the inability of Congress to pass anything. Arthur: We\u2019ve heard the current administration make exactly that claim: that the economy is doing pretty well in spite of Republican-led gridlock. I don\u2019t buy it \u2014 and clearly, neither do most Americans. While top-line economic growth has been positive, real wage growth has been zero or negative for the bottom 80 percent of the population since 2008. Meanwhile, about 85 percent of the stock market gains have flowed to the top 10 percent. I\u2019m starting to sound like John Edwards now, with his old \u201cTwo Americas\u201d schtick. I feel like I should take a shower. Gail: \u201cTwo Americas\u201d was the John Edwards high point. I\u2019m kinda touched you remember. Arthur: It was unforgettable. That and the fabulous hair. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But back to the subject at hand. It\u2019s not low growth, exactly, but rather unbalanced growth that is fueling support for the surprisingly similar populisms of Trump and Sanders. Clinton surely understands that \u201cfree college for all\u201d and similar gewgaws won\u2019t fix what ails us. The situation requires tough-minded policies for balanced economic growth and job creation. A lot of policies that would help us toward these ends, like free trade, share support from economists on the left and right alike \u2014 but they aren\u2019t much in the conversation right now. Gail: President Obama\u2019s problem has been an inability to get Congress to cooperate with anything more ambitious than kicking the can down the road. Clinton\u2019s big change would be to actually work with Congress and get things done. It\u2019s ironic, since Obama beat her by promising to transcend the old-brain dead political squabbles and move the country forward. I still remember Hillary kind of staring at him when he made that sound so easy. Arthur: Hey, now we\u2019re giving Hillary the same advice: Be the person who is determined to work with everybody and doesn\u2019t treat the other side with contempt. I\u2019m big into that advice these days. Now it\u2019s your turn to make a prediction. I get asked this one constantly: Will Hillary be indicted, or is that just a crazy conservative fantasy? Gail: That is a crazy conservative fantasy. However, having lived through the times I have lived through, I would never discount the possibility of some other huge scandal that she basically had nothing to do with but which would throw the entire election year into a tailspin.

(At least if you believe the polls on trustworthiness.) Gail: Since every president winds up doing things they swore they would never, ever, ever do, I think in the end voters will get past the trustworthy issue. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Arthur: Can I trust you on that? One last thing: Today we\u2019ll get results from Utah and Arizona, plus Idaho for the Democrats. Any surprises in store? Gail: I guess the big question is whether Mitt Romney\u2019s decision to vote for Ted Cruz in Utah, but not to endorse Ted Cruz, will have any influence on confused Utah Republicans.

        "parsed_article": "It was the signal the Citizens United ruling sent that has been a much bigger deal. The majority decision went beyond the question in the case to assert that only quid pro quo corruption \u2014 a measurable exchange of legislative favors for campaign money \u2014 justified regulation, indicating that the court would look skeptically on most campaign-finance limits. And, particularly because of the uproar surrounding the decision, donors and political strategists believed that an era of \u201canything goes\u201d had begun, and they behaved accordingly, testing all kinds of limits, such as using nonprofit organizations to finance election campaigns. If the real impact of Citizens United was symbolic, reversing it would be equally symbolic \u2014 but symbolism matters. Still, there would remain much work to be done. At the very least, the court would also have to reverse decisions foreshadowing Citizens United, rolling the clock back to the 2003 Supreme Court decision that used actual evidence to uphold most of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (known as McCain-Feingold). But some of the practices and frauds that political operatives have developed since the Citizens United decision will not easily be put back in the bag. And if we did succeed in rolling the campaign finance clock back to 2003, at best we would have something like the election of 2004, which was free of super PACs but did feature organizations like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which went after the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, and received more than half of its nearly $18 million in funding from three wealthy Texans. Photo To enable Congress to limit the influence of these megadonors, the court would have to go all the way back to its 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo. The court said that Congress or states could put limits on contributions, in the interest of controlling corruption, but not on total spending, or on candidates\u2019 funding their own campaigns, or on external spending like the Swift Boat campaign that is not coordinated with the campaign. As a result, candidates find themselves caught in an arms race: trying to raise enough money to compete, in contributions of $2,700 or less (far more than any middle-class family can spare), often facing opponents funding their own campaigns or incumbents with established fund-raising machines or outside money. There\u2019s a natural pressure to find a way out of that trap, using whatever technique your lawyers and consultants cook up. That\u2019s why every politician who has support from large donors now has a supportive super PAC. And there will always be a way out. The problem is not the Supreme Court \u2014 it\u2019s the First Amendment itself. The challenge in regulating campaign spending is not deciding whether money is speech or corporations have rights, it\u2019s defining the boundaries of the election. Elections are a special zone, and by regulating spending clearly intended to influence the election, we keep it a zone of political fairness, where voters hear all sides and elected officials can remain independent. (Think of it like the signs limiting electioneering within 75 feet of the polling place.) Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The provisions challenged in Citizens United and the earlier cases all dealt with the question, \u201cWhat makes an ad an election ad?\u201d Before 2002, the principle was that it had to have \u201cmagic words\u201d like \u201cvote for.\u201d McCain-Feingold tried to establish that broadcast ads that mentioned a candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before an election would be considered campaign ads (\u201celectioneering communication\u201d). That\u2019s what brought Citizens United, the organization, and its movie attacking Hillary Clinton, to the attention of the Federal Election Commission in 2008. But what about speech that mentions candidates long before an election? Or ads that don\u2019t mention a candidate at all? For example, groups funded by the Koch family ran ads in the congressional elections of 2014 attacking \u201cObamacare\u201d without ever mentioning a congressional candidate by name. When party and ideology are as tightly aligned as they are, an ad doesn\u2019t need to connect all the dots to push a voter who dislikes President Obama\u2019s health insurance program to vote Republican or an environmental activist to vote Democratic. But this kind of robust open debate about public issues is exactly what the First Amendment is intended to protect. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then there are all the other ways that the wealthy influence policy, without getting involved in elections \u2014 through media, lobbying and philanthropy. Each channel is legitimate and most efforts to restrict them would create more problems than they solved. What Mr. Sanders calls \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d will not lose its influence even after all the court decisions back to 1976 have been reversed. It may be futile to try to restrict the influence of the very wealthy, but we can offset it by opening the system up and making it easier for a candidate to run and be heard, or for people working together to put a new idea on the agenda. Both Democratic presidential candidates have called for some kind of system of public financing that matches small donations, along the lines of New York City\u2019s program, which matches small contributions six to one. Every current citywide elected official participated in the system, and small donors, including the match, accounted for 61 percent of the money spent in the 2013 elections. Seattle\u2019s new program of vouchers, which gives every citizen $100 to donate to campaigns, is promising but so far untested, while some conservatives are enthusiastic about using tax credits to encourage small donors. While the Supreme Court has struck some provisions of these programs, they mostly remain intact, even in the Citizens United world, and a court without Justice Scalia is likely to be even friendlier to the idea of expanding political opportunity. Technology can combine with these programs to give campaigns a low-cost start through sites like NationBuilder that provide most of what a candidate needs, including an accurate list of voters, at minimal cost. We can also begin to think creatively about how to ensure that the broad interests of the public are heard as loudly as those who can hire lobbyists. After Citizens United, the next step is not backward, toward old laws that didn\u2019t work well, but forward, toward a politics that respects and expands free expression and robust debate.",

        "parsed_article": "I wish that were true. In fact, the government has candidly told the Supreme Court that we \u201cdon\u2019t get an exemption\u201d at all. Rather, what Health and Human Services is calling an \u201copt-out\u201d is really an \u201copt-in\u201d \u2014 a permission slip where we authorize the use of our religious health plan to offer services that violate our beliefs and waive our protections under federal civil rights laws. That\u2019s why they need our signature. The government says this isn\u2019t a problem because it will pay for the services that violate our religious beliefs. But for us this is not a money question; it is a moral question about what we offer in our plan. It\u2019s similar to high schools that have removed soda machines from their property because they don\u2019t think soda is good for children. It doesn\u2019t matter that the soda companies will pay for the machines. And the school\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t prevent children from getting soda elsewhere. The school simply doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for providing something it believes is bad for its students. It is the same with us. We follow Catholic teaching that abortion and contraception are wrong, but it is very important to understand that this case is not about women\u2019s access to contraception. The administration already exempts many secular corporations like Exxon Mobil and Visa from having to provide the services we are objecting to, because those companies never updated their plans and are \u201cgrandfathered.\u201d Add in the exempted plans for military families, the uninsured and cities like New York, and about a third of all Americans don\u2019t have plans covered by this mandate. We recognize that not everyone agrees with us, and that the government will make laws and provide services we don\u2019t support. But in a free and diverse society, the American government should not force its citizens to act in violation of their religious beliefs, especially when there are so many exemptions already, and much more effective ways to meet the government\u2019s stated goals. The obvious alternative to forcing us to offer these services is for the government to allow our employees to access them through its own health care exchanges. This would both protect our religious freedom and better meet the government\u2019s own goal of providing contraception coverage to women \u2014 those in protected religious plans and the millions of American women in exempted secular plans.

Finally, some have argued that the Little Sisters aren\u2019t a religious group \u2014 that our willingness to care for the elderly poor regardless of their religious beliefs and hire people to help provide that care who haven\u2019t taken the same vows we have means we\u2019re a social service organization, not a religious one. But Jesus never demanded that the poor demonstrate strict adherence to religious doctrine before helping them. And many religious organizations employ people of diverse backgrounds. Rather than being an indication we aren\u2019t really religious, we believe our willingness to work with and care for anyone is one of the truest ways to live out the religious faith that animates our ministry. Our goal with this case is to have the freedom to follow our conscience in what we do and offer. The women who take the vows to become Little Sisters of the Poor do so out of deep love and religious conviction. We spend our days caring for, learning from, and serving those whom many in our society would prefer to forget. All we are asking is that the government allow us to continue that work.",

        "parsed_article": "Every current member of the Supreme Court attended either Harvard or Yale. Their life experiences varied, of course, before arriving at those institutions. Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor both rose from modest circumstances. And Judge Garland also fits within this meritocratic ideal: A young Garland worked as a tutor, stocked shoes in a shoe store and even sold his comic book collection, as the president noted in his announcement, to help put himself through Harvard Law School. But all that work and sacrifice can be for naught if an ambitious young lawyer doesn\u2019t achieve a circumscribed set of accomplishments. The easiest way to become a federal judge, not to mention a justice, is to spend your career surrounded by elites. That stems, in part, from the fact that it is easier to obtain power if you have powerful friends, but an even bigger factor is the highly fraught confirmation process, which punishes r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that advertise politics. If a lawyer spends his career in a large firm representing corporate clients, that is considered a politically neutral credential, as is service as a prosecutor. These jobs give a nominee plausible deniability when his record is attacked, as he can always excuse an uncomfortable argument that appears in a brief as a position he took on behalf of a client. In most cases, this excuse will even have the virtue of being true. But if someone works as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, or as a legal aid lawyer, or as a union lawyer, or in a plaintiffs\u2019 law firm, then she may as well tattoo the words \u201cBIG LEFTY\u201d on her forehead and walk into the confirmation hearing wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt.

Jane Kelly, one of a few judges whom President Obama was said to have interviewed before deciding on Judge Garland, was a public defender before becoming a judge. Nevertheless, the path to the Supreme Court grows narrower with each passing year. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a pioneering women\u2019s rights lawyer for the A.C.L.U. before her nomination to the federal bench. But she lamented in 2011 that her \u201cA.C.L.U. connection would probably disqualify me\u201d if she were put forward for the Supreme Court today. That\u2019s not to say that excellent judges cannot rise to our nation\u2019s highest court. Judge Garland\u2019s record as a court of appeals judge suggests that he is one of them. Nor should Judge Garland be punished for amassing credentials that set him up for the Supreme Court. Don\u2019t hate the player. Hate the game. Although the apparent consensus that Supreme Court justices must have gone to Harvard or Yale is a relatively recent development, there\u2019s always been a strong thread of elitism running through the legal profession\u2019s highest reaches. Alexis de Tocqueville wrote very early in our nation\u2019s history that \u201cAmerican aristocracy is found at the bar and on the bench.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story In their decisions, these American aristocrats blessed segregation, struck down child labor laws, upheld Japanese internment camps, permitted states to sterilize women against their will, gutted the Voting Rights Act and ushered a torrent of money into our politics. This grim history should be a warning to lawyers eager to win policy fights in the courts that should be left to the democratic process. Some of the court\u2019s worst decisions were the product of rigid ideology. But many are rooted in the fact that the justices in the majority lacked what President Obama said he was looking for in a nominee: \u201can understanding of the way the world really works.\u201d Without that understanding, a judge cannot grasp what life is like for people who have not successfully climbed to the top of a legal aristocracy, often at the expense of other pursuits. It is difficult to imagine, for example, that the Roberts Court would have cast such a skeptical eye on campaign finance laws if many of its members had run for office and witnessed firsthand how money corrupted politics. Should liberals gain a majority on the Supreme Court, their biggest challenge will be policing the line between their legitimate constitutional grievances and disputes that should be left to the elected branches. Conservatives gave in too often to temptation while they held a majority on the court \u2014 just consider the series of challenges to Obamacare that made their way to the court. If the balance of power shifts, liberals would make a terrible mistake by following their example. America is rooted in the idea that legitimate authority to govern flows only from the consent of the governed. Meritocracy and respect for credentials both have their place in a society that needs competent leaders to hold the reins of government. But elite credentials cannot teach a judge what it means to seek shelter in the law, or how it feels to be a victim of discrimination. And a wise judge must understand his own limitations.",

Two political scientists, Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, argue that America\u2019s achievements rest on a foundation of government services but that we Americans suffer from \u201cAmerican Amnesia\u201d (that\u2019s also the title of their book coming out this month) and don\u2019t appreciate this. \u201cWe are told that the United States got rich in spite of government, when the truth is closer to the opposite,\u201d they write. Every country that journeyed from mass illiteracy and poverty to modernity and wealth did so, they note, because of government instruments that are now often scorned. These instruments also create a sense of national identity that eclipses tribal identities, even if this process is still incomplete in America. I came across a group of homeless women and girls in the South Sudan swamps, hiding from soldiers who would have killed or raped them. One teenager was wearing a castoff T-shirt that read \u201cObama Girl,\u201d so I asked her if she knew who Barack Obama was. She was confused; there are no functioning schools in the area, so she can\u2019t read and didn\u2019t know what her shirt said. But I explained. That didn\u2019t help, for she had never heard of Obama. I asked her friends if they knew, and finally I found one woman who did. She said shyly that Obama is president of the United States.

And the Nuer are related to the Luo tribe, which is the tribe of President Obama\u2019s father. So a Nuer now cannot in practice become president of South Sudan, but someone of similar ancestry can be president of the United States. That\u2019s an inclusiveness that enriches America and that should be a source of pride.

Carson, like so many conservatives, isn\u2019t truly interested in unity as much as silent submission, a quiet in which one can pretend that hostility has been quashed, all evidence to the contrary. These are folks who view discussions about reducing racial inequity and increasing queer equality as divisive. They are people who see efforts to protect women\u2019s health, in particular their full range of reproductive options, including abortion, and to reverse our staggering income inequality as divisive. Indeed, the very words white supremacy, privilege, racism, bias, sexism, misogyny, patriarchy, homophobia, and poverty are seen as divisive. Somehow, they think, these very real oppressive forces will simply die if only deprived of conversational oxygen. In fact, the opposite is true. By not naming these forces and continuously confronting, they strengthen and spread. Carson\u2019s endorsement further tarnished his already tarnished reputation. He validated and rubber-stamped a grandiloquent fascist who is supported by a former grand wizard. All Carson\u2019s calls for civility were in that moment proven hollow. No wonder so many Americans despise politicians and see them as soulless and without principle.

Chris Christie\u2019s endorsement of the front-runner is just as baffling and unprincipled. As The Los Angeles Times put it: \u201cChristie had spent years curating an image as a policy-focused administrator who reached out to Muslims and Latinos, and he was rewarded with rock star status in the national Republican Party. Now he\u2019s backing a candidate who has insulted minorities, shown a casual disregard for policy discussions and is reviled by the party\u2019s establishment.\u201d And yet it is Carson\u2019s endorsement that I find more interesting, not because it will have a greater impact, but because he and the front-runner are two sides of the same coin: they are both dangerous, but one is a narcissist who just might win the nomination and the other is a near-narcoleptic who never had a chance.",

One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier \u2014 and plenty of people will buy it, saying: \u201cWhy not give him a chance?

Watch out. I\u2019ve seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election. His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republicans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. \u201cDid you hear what Trump said about Hillary last night?

Before 2000, the size of both the lower and middle classes had shrunk, while the percentage of households with inflation-adjusted incomes of $100,000 or more grew. Americans were moving up the ladder. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After 2000, the middle class continued to shrink, but so did the percentage of households making $100,000 or more. The only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of $35,000 or less. Americans were moving down the ladder. (This downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article.) The second adverse trend is that trade with China, which shot up after China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, imposed far larger costs on American workers than most economists anticipated, according to recent studies. And the costs of trade with China have fallen most harshly on workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder. In their January 2016 paper, \u201cThe China Shock,\u201d David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson, economists at M.I.T., the University of Zurich and the University of California-San Diego respectively, found that If one had to project the impact of China\u2019s momentous economic reform for the U.S. labor market with nothing to go on other than a standard undergraduate economics textbook, one would predict large movements of workers between U.S. tradable industries (say, from apparel and furniture to pharmaceuticals and jet aircraft), limited reallocation of jobs from tradables to non-tradables, and no net impacts on U.S. aggregate employment. The reality of adjustment to the China shock has been far different. Employment has certainly fallen in U.S. industries most exposed to import competition. But so too has overall employment in local labor markets in which these industries were concentrated. Offsetting employment gains either in export-oriented tradables or in non-tradables have, for the most part, failed to materialize. High wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and \u201cdo not experience an earnings loss,\u201d argue Autor and his colleagues. Low wage workers, in contrast, \u201csuffer large differential earnings loss, as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers.\u201d This is why Trump\u2019s charge that China has gotten the better of the United States has gained traction. The Shrinking Middle Class Over about the past half-century, the middle class has shrunk consistently. Before 2000, this was primarily because more Americans moved up the income ladder. But since 2000, more have fallen down. Percentage of households in the United States by income range, 1967\u20132013: Low Middle High Less than $35,000 $35,000\u2013100,000 More than $100,000 53% 45 43 40% 34 31 25 22 7% \u201967 \u201967 \u201967 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 Percentage of households in the United States by income range, 1967\u20132013: Low Middle High < $35,000 $35\u2013100,000 > $100,000 53 45 43 40% 34 31 22 25 7 \u201967 \u201967 \u201967 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 When I asked Gordon Hanson what factors provoked the populist insurgencies in both parties in this particular election cycle, he emailed back: The recipe for populism seems pretty clear: take a surge in manufacturing imports from China and continued automation in the US workplace and add a tepid macroeconomy. The result is a combustible stew sure to sour the stomach of party leaders nationwide. The stew, to continue Hanson\u2019s metaphor, began to boil over with the cataclysmic financial collapse in September 2008, which many people left and right felt was caused by reckless financial engineering on Wall Street. The collapse and the destruction it left in its wake was, without question, the most important economic and political event in recent years. \u201cIt was the financial crisis, what it revealed about government-Wall Street links, and the fumbling of the response to it that put the nail in the coffin of trust in government,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in reply to my questions. \u201cOnce trust in government was destroyed, those that had not benefited from the previous boom years became particularly easy pickings for populist rhetoric.\u201d On Oct. 3, 2008, Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. TARP funds bailed out major investment banks, and were also used, as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis put it, \u201cto make loans and direct equity investments to select auto industry participants, backstop credit markets, provide a lifeline to the American International Group (AIG) and provide ongoing support for government housing initiatives\u201d \u2013 but in addition, TARP insulated the very institutions and executives that caused the collapse and the disastrous recession that followed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI don\u2019t think you can underestimate or underemphasize the impact of the bailout,\u201d Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think Washington think tank, told me in an email: The widespread sense that all the elites in Washington and New York conspired to bail out the miscreants who caused the disaster and then gave them bonuses, while the rest of us lost our houses or saw their value, the biggest and often only asset of Americans, plummet, lost our jobs or saw them frozen and stagnant, and then saw gaping inequality grow even more, is just palpable. On Jan. 10, 2010, the Supreme Court granted those in upper income brackets additional privileges in its Citizens United decision (buttressed by subsequent lower court rulings) that allowed wealthy individuals, corporations and unions to make unlimited political contributions. By opening the door to the creation of Super PACs and giving Wall Street and other major financial sectors new ways to buy political outcomes, the courts gave the impression, to say the least, that they favored establishment interests over those of the less well off. A Bloomberg poll last September found that 78 percent of voters would like to see Citizens United overturned, and this view held across a range of partisan loyalties: Republicans at 80 percent; Democrats at 83; and independents at 71. In March 2010, two months after Citizens United was decided, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, a program many in the white middle and working classes perceived as reducing their own medical care in order to provide health coverage to the disproportionately minority poor.

By the midterm elections of 2010, voter dissatisfaction among whites found expression in the Tea Party movement, which produced the sweeping defeat of Democrats in competitive congressional districts as well as of moderate and center-right Republicans in primary contests. Voter anger was directed at two targets \u2014 the \u201cundeserving rich\u201d and the \u201cundeserving poor.\u201d The 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms. To many of those who cast their ballots in anger in 2010 and 2014, however, it appeared that their votes had not changed anything. Obamacare stayed in place, Wall Street and corporate America grew richer, while the average worker was stuck going nowhere. Already disillusioned with the Democratic Party, these white voters became convinced that the mainstream of the Republican Party had failed them, not only on economic issues, but on cultural matters as well. A September 2015 Ipsos survey asked voters if they agreed or disagreed with the statement \u201cMore and more, I don\u2019t identify with what America has become.\u201d 72 percent of surveyed Republicans concurred, compared to 58 percent of independents and 45 percent of Democrats. Two thirds of Republicans, 62 percent, agreed with the statement \u201cThese days I feel like a stranger in my own country,\u201d compared to 53 percent of independents and 37 percent of Democrats. Here is one place where Trump\u2019s scathing dismissal of political correctness found fertile ground. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard Republicans: The intersection of inequality driven by real wage/income stagnation and the fact that the folks perceived to have blown the damn economy up not only recovered first, but got government assistance in the form of bailouts to do so. If you\u2019re in the anxious middle and that doesn\u2019t deeply piss you off, you\u2019re an unusually forgiving person. In these circumstances, Bernstein wrote, the logic supporting the traditional Republican Party fell apart: The core theme of Republican establishment lore has been to demonize not unregulated finance or trade or inequality, but \u2018the other\u2019 \u2013 e.g., the immigrant or minority taking your job and claiming unneeded government support. And yet, none of their trickle down, deregulatory agenda helped ameliorate the problem at all. So they lost control. Just as animosity to Republican power brokers in Washington intensified, the Republican Party began to splinter. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I asked Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor, \u201cAre party establishments now fictions, no longer able to exercise control?\u201d Persily responded: This election has demonstrated that there is no Republican Party organization, per se. The Republican Party exists as an array of allied groups, incumbent office holders, media organizations, and funding vehicles (e.g., SuperPACs, 501(c)(4)s, and the like). When people ask why the \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cthe party\u201d has not done anything to stop Trump, it is not exactly clear who they mean. On Super Tuesday, Donald Trump won a majority of the dozen states that were up for grabs. He collected far more delegates than Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. The tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that Trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fool\u2019s errand. If he is shoved out of the field somehow, his supporters will remain bitter and enraged, convinced that a self-serving and malign elite defeated their leader. If he prevails, a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him.",

        "parsed_article": "The Sanders effort has attracted a fierce following among young people, political independents, McGovernite liberals once forced into political exile by Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic Leadership Council, and working-class white voters, whose broad sense of anger, economic displacement and distrust of institutions are also fueling the rise of Donald J. Trump on the right. Mr. Sanders\u2019s message has resonated least with the groups most likely to be defensive of President Obama: African-Americans and Latinos, as well as women over 60, who have expressed a greater sense of investment in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s quest to become the first woman president. When he ran for president in 2008, Mr. Obama was the candidate of the young and the demographically ascendant. He eventually attracted strong majorities among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and voters under 30. Mr. Obama\u2019s message was inspirational and nationally cathartic, to be sure. But it was far from revolutionary, though his candidacy, given his race, certainly was. He called on the country to put aside differences of region, color and class and to join together toward a common and prosperous future. Hardly the stuff of Eugene V. Debs. He promised to put an end to the Bush economic disaster and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and to pass universal health care, completing a Democratic dream dating back at least to F.D.R. The most populist idea Mr. Obama offered was his vow to repeal the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich, while keeping them in place for the middle class. After Mrs. Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in 2008, Mr. Obama responded with an intonation crafted in defeat, which was designed to stir not revolutionary fervor, but patriotic hope; proclaiming that it was \u201cwritten into the founding documents\u201d of a flawed but earnest nation yearning to perfect its union: \u201cYes, we can.\u201d Mr. Obama was arguing for his own electability as a black man in a country that had never elected anything but a white man as president. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Candidate Obama didn\u2019t favor overturning the country\u2019s private health care system or even instituting the individual mandate to purchase health insurance that Senator Clinton insisted was necessary to extend coverage, though he later adopted it as president. And Mr. Obama vehemently fought the notion that he was a socialist, or even out of the ideological mainstream. He ran as a centrist and a national healer, clearly not knowing that he would face an opposition once in office that was equal parts trenchant and ideologically radical. Once elected, Mr. Obama faced immediate and continual fire from vocal contingents on the right, but also from influential left-wing bloggers and liberal and libertarian radio hosts whom the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs derided in 2010 as \u201cthe professional left.\u201d Some of these figures have dined out on the theme that Mr. Obama promised them a revolution and sold out instead to the establishment and the big banks. The liberal TV and radio veteran and longtime columnist Bill Press has even written a book on the theme, \u201cBuyer\u2019s Remorse: How Obama Let Progressives Down,\u201d for which Mr. Sanders provided a blurb. But many African-Americans chafed at the fact that these mostly white liberals had hardly given the new, and first black, president \u2014 with all the unique historic challenges the latter fact entailed \u2014 time to tackle the sinking economy and get health care through before demanding that he issue executive orders defying the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d law and somehow unilaterally close the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison without the consent of Congress. Mr. Obama and his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., were excoriated for failing to jail Wall Street bankers whose rapaciousness triggered the Great Recession. Of all the liberal resentments during the Obama years, one of the sharpest has been the failure to secure a public insurance option as part of the Affordable Care Act. And while Mr. Sanders frequently points out that he was a member of a committee that helped draft Obamacare, he still wants to scrap it in favor of a European-style single-payer model, which would certainly face an even harder time getting through Congress than Obamacare did. Some prominent liberals called for voters to punish Mr. Obama during the 2010 midterms. They got their way, as Democratic voters stayed home in droves, something that often happens in midterm elections but was especially devastating in a census year. African-Americans have paid the heaviest price, as the 2010 election stripped them, particularly in the South, of significant political power as a result of redistricting. In 2011, as a guest on Thom Hartmann\u2019s radio show, Mr. Sanders added his voice to those calling for Mr. Obama to face a primary challenge, based on outrage over the administration\u2019s willingness to put changes to the Social Security formula on the table in the quest for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d budget deal. He was joined in the call to challenge Mr. Obama by his current surrogate, Cornel West, the African-American scholar whose acid critiques over the last eight years have included referring to the president as a \u201cblack mascot of Wall Street\u201d who \u201chas a certain fear of free black men.\u201d Today, Mr. Sanders is struggling to add Obama Democrats, particularly voters of color, to his coalition.

(People, this is just an aside, but why do you think these debates now go on for two and a half hours? Do you think it\u2019s some kind of test to make sure the final nominee is physically fit? It seems a little strange that in our Twitter-centric age \u2014 when, according to one recent study, the average attention span of an adult is shorter than that of a goldfish \u2014 we\u2019re presuming the voting public wants longer programming.) Ben Carson and John Kasich tried to take the high road, which meant that afterward, nobody was quoting anything they said except Carson\u2019s explanation of his philosophy on Supreme Court nominations: \u201cThe fruit salad of their life is what I would look at.\u201d Ted Cruz was his lovable self \u2014 at one point, when Trump fell back on his mantra about not wanting to see people \u201cdie on the streets,\u201d Cruz demanded to know if that meant the government had to \u201cpay for everyone\u2019s health care.\u201d But Rubio took control. He ran through stories about Trump\u2019s worker-unfriendly business practices \u2014 like the Times story by Charles Bagli and Megan Twohey on the way his Mar-a-Lago Club ignores applications from Americans in favor of guest workers from places like Romania. And the illegal Polish workers who were once brought in to do a Trump demolition job. That case goes back more than 30 years, and since they were hired by a contractor, it\u2019s perfectly possible Trump had no idea what was going on. This is true of so many of the things Trump takes credit for. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve hired a thousand people from another country,\u201d Rubio overstated. \u201cYou\u2019ve had nothing but problems with your credit cards et cetera, so don\u2019t tell me about that,\u201d Trump rejoined. And so it went. You can understand why Rubio felt that getting personal was the only way to go. Trump has been breezing through the campaign without making any discernible effort to come up with coherent policies, or even to keep his stories straight. (He\u2019s amended his old explanation for his failure to release his tax returns. The problem apparently is no longer the complexity of the project, but a government audit that mysteriously precludes him from revealing any of the information.)

The most optimistic analysis of Trump as a presidential candidate is that he just doesn\u2019t believe in positions, except the ones you adopt for strategic purposes when you\u2019re making a deal. So you obviously can\u2019t explain how you\u2019re going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, because it\u2019s going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session. Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t have the discipline to sit down and work this stuff out. The great moment of debate night, as far as I\u2019m concerned, came after the actual debate was over, and Trump suggested in a CNN postgame interview, that the I.R.S. might audit him a lot \u201cbecause of the fact that I\u2019m a strong Christian \u2026 and maybe there\u2019s a bias.\u201d Then in a CNN post-postgame interview Trump took it all back.

Schedules? Golf scores? Dinner plans? This month, Trump still seemed to be moving in the same general health care direction. In a CNN town hall, Anderson Cooper mentioned the Obamacare mandate that everybody must have insurance. The Republicans hate this idea. They believe all Americans have a God-given right to refuse to get health coverage and throw themselves on the mercies of extremely expensive hospital emergency rooms if they get ill. \u201cWell, I like the mandate,\u201d said Trump. \u201cO.K., so here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different. I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets and I say this all the time.\u201d This is how far we have fallen. The leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination keeps bragging that he does not want people dying in the streets. \u201cNow some people would say, \u2018That\u2019s not a very Republican thing to say,\u2019\u201d he told Cooper. Wow, Trump clearly has a very low opinion of Republicans. As well as insurance companies. Do you see why a desperate citizen might think he\u2019s the lesser of three front-running evils? Remember, right now the party\u2019s sensible establishment candidate is a person who does not want to allow abortions for rape victims and who basically believes that the only people who should have to pay taxes are the ones who worked for the money. Trump said the poor people could be taken care of \u201cthrough maybe concepts of Medicare. \u2026 That\u2019s called heart.\u201d Fast forward three days. Trump is back at CNN talking with Jake Tapper, denying that he wants any mandate. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pop quiz. After Donald Trump said he did not want a health care mandate after all, he added that he also did not want: A) Any more hard questions. B) People dying in the streets. You\u2019re right! The answer is B, and in case anyone missed his big-heartedness, Trump added that people would not be \u201cdying on the sidewalks\u201d either. One of the most universally popular parts of Obamacare is the requirement that insurance companies can\u2019t discriminate against people who have pre-existing conditions like diabetes or a prior bout with cancer. The problem is how to keep everybody from waiting until they get sick to insure themselves. You can just create a kind of Medicare for all. Or you can require people to buy insurance, and help the low-income pay the cost. \u201cI don\u2019t like the term mandate, personally, because that sort of means mandatory,\u201d Trump explained. So what the heck does he want? Well, I checked with his campaign. He wants people to be able to establish health savings accounts. He is also looking into the possibility of letting the states run Medicaid with federal block grants, and making health insurance premiums tax-deductible.

We will skip over the part where Trump is this far down the road and still working on a basic plan. The more important point is that he\u2019s coming down to a health care policy that is the same as Marco Rubio\u2019s and Ted Cruz\u2019s. \u201cIf most Republicans didn\u2019t agree on most of the features of reform then you\u2019d have a story. The fact that they agree should not be a surprise to anyone,\u201d said Sam Clovis, the campaign\u2019s senior policy adviser, in a phone interview. The bottom line is that once you really pin him down, Donald Trump is a mail-order conservative Republican, except more trash-talking about Muslims and Mexicans.

In Iowa, he drew more evangelical Christian voters than his rivals did, but in South Carolina, Trump beat him among those voters, and Rubio wasn\u2019t far behind. Some of them told reporters, including me, that they\u2019d been turned off by behavior of Cruz\u2019s that they deemed un-Christian. This dynamic could cripple him in the Southern states that vote in the first half of March, and his strategy hinges on those states. With their evangelical voters in mind, he frames himself as the candidate truest to Scripture and fiercest in the battle against such scourges (in his estimation) as gay marriage. That framing implicitly questions rivals\u2019 devotion. And his onetime proclamation that \u201cany president who doesn\u2019t begin every day on his knees isn\u2019t fit to be commander in chief\u201d is a summons to rivals to prove their faith. He should focus instead on conduct that proves his own.",

If he wins the nomination, it will be only because many of the primaries award all their delegates to the one who gets more votes than anyone else rather than a candidate supported by the majority of the voters. This is an inherent problem in the way we choose a president. Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump still solidly outnumber those who support him.

It\u2019s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.\u201d No, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was \u201ca huge night for Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cNobody should kid themselves,\u201d he added. Trump didn\u2019t just win South Carolina, and he didn\u2019t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have. It began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren\u2019t typically receptive to that. Over the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump\u2019s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood. The week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he\u2019d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White? Then Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he\u2019d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This prompted extensive commentary on Trump\u2019s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble. But what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account\u2014what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters\u2014is that the people voting for him aren\u2019t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They\u2019re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They\u2019re not troubling themselves with whether the position he\u2019s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.

They want to try something utterly different\u2014utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour\u2014and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire. One woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won\u2019t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn\u2019t that be refreshing? Couldn\u2019t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot? She\u2019d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she\u2019s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around. Another woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what\u2019s in order. A man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Affairs department has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven\u2019t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn\u2019t he expect more of the same? Trump isn\u2019t the same. Gingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that Fox News appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don\u2019t care about the details.\u201d In an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group\u2014and got 63 percent of theirs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Going forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and fiercely as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent. That potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he\u2019d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South. And in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith. But Rubio hasn\u2019t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They\u2019re victories, plural. They\u2019re no fluke, no fad. Naysayers can\u2019t claim that he\u2019s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty\u2014if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore. All Trump\u2019s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner.

Like Cruz, who is 45, he found early favor with the Tea Party, which helped propel him to Washington. Like Cruz, he staunchly opposes new gun safety measures, abortion rights and Obamacare. Like Cruz, he has called for sweeping tax cuts, the abolition of the federal Department of Education, the relaxing of environmental regulations and unwavering friendship with Israel. Like Cruz, he has cast Antonin Scalia not just as a distinguished jurist but as a black-robed deity.

With a sunny voice, Rubio presented himself as an instrument of hope. With a gloomy one, Cruz played the vessel of dread. Rubio\u2019s smiles were frequent and expansive. Cruz\u2019s were rarer and clenched. The two of them emerged more clearly than ever as the Kennedy and Nixon of the Republican race, one counting on charisma, the other on voters\u2019 fears that all that stands between them and ruin is a warrior whose stridency proves his mettle. Rubio, granted, had more immediate cause for mirth: He\u2019d just won the formal backing of Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina. But the way he discussed that perfectly illustrated his campaign\u2019s timbre and emotional underpinnings. Cooper asked him whether he himself had ever felt \u201cthe sting of racism,\u201d and his answer was about how good America can be, not how bad. He encouraged Cooper and the audience to \u201clook at how far we\u2019ve come as a country since the 1960s\u201d and mentioned not just Haley but also Tim Scott, one of South Carolina\u2019s two United States senators, who is black. \u201cI got the endorsement of a governor of Indian descent, who endorsed a presidential candidate of Cuban descent and tomorrow will be campaigning alongside an African-American Republican senator,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAll three are doing that here in South Carolina.\u201d On the subject of tensions between police officers and African-Americans, he began with a tribute to the integrity of most men and women in blue. But he pivoted quickly to the observation that black men are singled out for suspicion, and said that whether Americans accept that or not, \u201cIf a significant percentage of the American family believes that they are being treated differently than everyone else, we have a problem.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be a president for all Americans, because an American president has to love the American people, even those that don\u2019t love you back,\u201d he said.

When Rubio joked about his fondness for electronic dance music, he got laughs. When Cruz broke into silly song to demonstrate how he serenades his wife on the phone, there was squirm-inducing silence. A typical Cruz campaign event is likely to include talk of \u201cthe abyss\u201d on which America teeters and what a terrifying juncture this is. \u201cI wake up scared every day,\u201d Cruz said at a rally in Charleston early Friday afternoon. David Limbaugh, Rush\u2019s brother, walked onstage to stand beside him and proclaim: \u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of collapse. We have maybe one last chance to save America.\u201d Phil Robertson, the prodigally bearded \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d commander, appeared, too. \u201cGuns and Bibles and the one who wrote it brought us here!\u201d he thundered. The audience roared, especially when it was suggested that Robertson might make a great vice president for Cruz. Cruz\u2019s methods can be ruthless, as Ben Carson learned in Iowa and as Rubio was reminded in South Carolina, where the Cruz campaign promoted images of Rubio not just shaking hands with Obama but merging with him, their two faces becoming one. \u201cNasty guy,\u201d Trump said of Cruz during the most recent Republican debate. Even he gets some things right. Although Cruz leans harder than Rubio does on the memory of Ronald Reagan, it\u2019s Rubio who has learned from Reagan \u2014 and from George W. Bush \u2014 that conservatism is best sold with uplift, at least usually. But these are unusual times \u2014 hotter, harsher. While Trump promises to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d he dwells on what chumps we are now. He\u2019s not trafficking in inspiration. He\u2019s validating a sense of victimization.

That may sound possible \u2014 until you remember that by 2026 more than a quarter of U.S. adults over 20 will be 65 and older, compared with 17 percent in 2000. Sorry, but there\u2019s just no way to justify this stuff. For wonks like me, it is, frankly, horrifying. Still, these are numbers on a program that Mr. Sanders, even if he made it to the White House, would have little chance of enacting. So do they matter? Unfortunately, the answer is yes, for several reasons. One is that, as the economists warn, fuzzy math from the left would make it impossible to effectively criticize conservative voodoo. Beyond that, this controversy is an indication of a campaign, and perhaps a candidate, not ready for prime time. These claims for the Sanders program aren\u2019t just implausible, they\u2019re embarrassing to anyone remotely familiar with economic history (which says that raising long-run growth is very hard) and changing demography. They should have set alarm bells ringing, but obviously didn\u2019t. And there\u2019s an even larger issue here: Good ideas don\u2019t have to be sold with fairy dust. Mr. Sanders is calling for a large expansion of the U.S. social safety net, which is something I would like to see, too. But the problem with such a move is that it would probably create many losers as well as winners \u2014 a substantial number of Americans, mainly in the upper middle class, who would end up paying more in additional taxes than they would gain in enhanced benefits. By endorsing outlandish economic claims, the Sanders campaign is basically signaling that it doesn\u2019t believe its program can be sold on the merits, that it has to invoke a growth miracle to minimize the downsides of its vision. It is, in effect, confirming its critics\u2019 worst suspicions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What happens now? In the past, the Sanders campaign has responded to critiques by impugning the motives of the critics. But the authors of the critical letter that came out on Wednesday aren\u2019t just important economists, they\u2019re important figures in the progressive movement.

For example, Alan Krueger is one of the founders of modern research on minimum wages, which shows that moderate increases in the minimum don\u2019t cause major job loss. Christina Romer was a strong advocate for stimulus during her time in the White House, and a major figure in the pushback against austerity in the years that followed. The point is that if you dismiss the likes of Mr. Krueger or Ms. Romer as Hillary shills or compromised members of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d you\u2019re excommunicating most of the policy experts who should be your allies. So Mr. Sanders really needs to crack down on his campaign\u2019s instinct to lash out. More than that, he needs to disassociate himself from voodoo of the left \u2014 not just because of the political risks, but because getting real is or ought to be a core progressive value.",

        "parsed_article": "To liberal legal scholars, originalism looked dead by the middle of the 1980s. Academics had argued that there was just no reliable way to figure out the intentions of long dead people about matters they had never thought about. And in 1985, a famous paper by the constitutional historian H. Jefferson Powell showed that people like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton didn\u2019t themselves believe that later interpreters should seek guidance in their intentions. Originalism seemed to be at war with itself. Justice Scalia was among the first to argue that constitutional interpreters should not be interested in the intentions of the framers but in the original meaning of the words they used. Original meaning turned out to be a life vest for the theory, keeping it afloat among conservative legal scholars and even some liberal ones.

View all New York Times newsletters. Meanwhile, Justice Scalia took to the streets and gained a following. He was unrelenting and always on message. He was a single-issue constitutional theorist, and his issue was originalism. For Justice Scalia and his fans, you viewed modern issues through an 18th-century quizzing glass or else you were an \u201cactivist.\u201d There was no in between. His laser-sharp dissents garnered a lot of attention, but he didn\u2019t just talk through his opinions. He talked to lawyers and to legions of law students, using his charisma and the simplicity of his message to recruit foot soldiers who could peddle his message through organizations like the Federalist Society. Liberals, meanwhile, have struggled to rally around a coherent alternative language in which to talk about the Constitution. We have been Hillary Clinton to Justice Scalia\u2019s Bernie Sanders. Some of us promoted something called popular constitutionalism. (What\u2019s that, you say?) Others settled on \u201cminimalism.\u201d Others simply gave up and have tried to argue that originalism actually supports progressive outcomes. Trying to coopt Justice Scalia\u2019s message is the highest compliment we have paid him. Justice Scalia lost some panache in his later years. The elegies you will read over the coming days and weeks may not mention that, perhaps appropriately, but it was well known to close watchers of the court. His dissents were rarely witty, his jokes too many and not funny. More than occasionally, his questions at oral argument reflected inattention to the details of the record. In other words, as we know too well now, he was a mere mortal. But he will live on in as many liberal echo chambers as conservative ones. We will study his opinions, yes, but we will also study his speeches, his sound bites, his turns of phrase and his travel schedule. And often, when our colleagues aren\u2019t listening, we will say to ourselves, \u201cThe guy was good.\u201d May he rest in peace.",

        "parsed_article": "Photo Antonin Scalia, dead unexpectedly this weekend at 79, was not the most politically powerful justice during his three decades on the Supreme Court. That distinction belonged to the court\u2019s two swing votes, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and then Anthony M. Kennedy, respectively the philosopher queen and king of our fraying republican order. Unlike them, Scalia did not have the opportunity to write all his preferences into the law of the land. For every victory he won, there was a sharp defeat; for every important majority opinion a stinging, quotable dissent. And on the issues he cared the most about \u2013 abortion, above all \u2013 his defeats were famous and his dissents often not just eloquent but anguished. But in every other respect, he was the most important Supreme Court justice of his era. He was important because of his intellectual influence. There were and are many legal theories and schools of constitutional interpretation within the world of American conservatism. But Scalia\u2019s combination of brilliance, eloquence and good timing \u2014 he was appointed to the court in 1986, a handful of years after the Federalist Society was founded, and with it the conservative legal movement as we know it \u2014 ensured that his ideas, originalism in constitutional law and textualism in statutory interpretation, would set the agenda for a serious judicial conservatism and define the worldview that any \u201cliving Constitution\u201d liberal needed to wrestle with in order to justify his own position. This intellectual importance was compounded by the way he strained to be consistent, to rule based on principle rather than on his partisan biases \u2014 which made him stand out in an age when justices often seem as purely partisan as any other office holder. Of course there were plenty of cases (\u201cBush v. Gore!\u201d a liberal might interject here) in which those biases probably did shape the way he ruled. But from flag burning to the rights of the accused to wartime detention, Scalia had a long record of putting originalist principle above a partisan conservatism. And this, too, set an example for his fellow conservatives: The fact that today the court\u2019s right-leaning bloc has far more interesting internal disagreements than the often lock-step-voting liberal wing is itself a testament to the premium its leading intellectual light placed on philosophical rigor and integrity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Finally, Scalia\u2019s eloquence and brio ensured that his influence was not just intellectual but also personal. Countless conservative legal eagles who came of age after 1986 will talk about how it was Scalia who inspired them to pursue a career in the law, Scalia who showed them what it meant to be an intellectually fulfilled right-winger in a profession that tilts left, Scalia whose good-humored zest for intellectual combat shaped their own approach to controversy. Indeed, there are few professional conservatives, period \u2014 academics or think tankers or even newspaper columnists \u2014 who have not been influenced in some sense by Scalia\u2019s words, his writing, his mind.",

        "parsed_article": "Photo In a farcical abuse of common sense and the American taxpayer, the Internal Revenue Service has granted Crossroads GPS, the dark-money machine of Karl Rove, the Republicans\u2019 guru of attack politics, status as a tax-exempt \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization. This means it can keep its deep-pocketed campaign donors secret. The ludicrous I.R.S. finding that the group is not primarily what it so obviously is \u2014 a strident G.O.P. operation that should be required to name its donors \u2014 is essentially a license for it to run amok in the current federal election cycle with anonymous, unlimited donations. The ruling, quietly made in November and brought to light this week by the Center for Responsive Politics, signals a shameful retreat by the I.R.S. from enforcing regulations intended to prevent abuses of the nonprofit tax law by campaign operatives. The agency had come under attack from Tea Party and other right-wing groups for questioning their claims to be \u201csocial welfare\u201d exemptions, and the Rove ruling is the latest result. It can only invite more partisan operatives to pretend to have society\u2019s nonpolitical interests at heart as they fill campaign troughs with money from hidden donors. Since pioneering this fiction, Mr. Rove has proved to be no Mother Teresa of a social welfare advocate, as he strategizes obsessively for Republican hegemony. His group has spent $330 million on election ads and candidate support since it was created in 2010, after the Supreme Court freed corporations and unions from political spending limits, according to the center\u2019s watchdog blog, Open Secrets. The dodge has become bipartisan, with President Obama\u2019s re-election helped by the Democrats\u2019 Priorities USA Action operation as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code.

Similar vows are being heard from the candidates for the Democratic nomination this year. Senator Bernie Sanders so far has been riding a wave of small donations, while Hillary Clinton, aided by \u201csuper PACs\u201d and small donors, is promising to rein in the special-interest money driving the current campaign. Republican candidates would rather talk about walling off Mexico and ending Obamacare, even as they profit from operations like Mr. Rove\u2019s. The public\u2019s voice is sorely needed on an issue that is at the very heart of concern over an affluent minority\u2019s growing power in American politics.

        "parsed_article": "I asked Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, just how conservative Cruz is. Abramowitz replied: Cruz\u2019s positions are on the far right of the Republican Party today, which would certainly place him far to the right of past conservative leaders like Reagan or Gingrich during his years as Speaker. In fact, his voting record is among the 2 or 3 most consistently conservative in the Senate. He is very conservative on every issue dimension: economic policy, social policy and national security/foreign policy. He is running on that record \u2014 emphasizing his purity compared with his rivals. Cruz fits the conservative bill of particulars on every count. Edward Carmines, a political scientist at Indiana University, affirmed Abramowitz\u2019s judgment: What Cruz represents is the embodiment of the hard right; he has extremely conservative positions not just on economic and social welfare issues like social security, health care, affirmative action programs for women and minorities, and taxes but also on social and cultural issues such as gun control, prayer in schools, abortion, and gay marriage. Cruz\u2019s extremism has been statistically presented by Keith Poole, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. Poole has produced a chart, based on voting records, of the ideological positions of presidential candidates who have served in the House or Senate. The chart shows Cruz\u2019s voting record as substantially more conservative than that of Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham or Bob Dole. Cruz\u2019s nomination would turn the general election in November into an almost perfect test of the viability of a pure conservative. The pragmatic wing, which overwhelmingly opposes a Cruz nomination, includes many of the party\u2019s consultants and strategists, much of the Republican lobbying community and some elected Republicans from blue and purple states. The strategic views of this wing are embodied in the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2013 Growth and Opportunity Project report, a.k.a. the autopsy report, calling for moderation of positions seen as anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-women and as intolerant of religious diversity. Without addressing the issues of abortion and reproductive rights by name, the report clearly called for moderation of hard-line stands: When it comes to social issues, the Party must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming. If we are not, we will limit our ability to attract young people and others, including many women, who agree with us on some but not all issues. Cruz has staked out what he calls \u201ccourageous conservatism,\u201d and refuses to budge from a hard-line anti-abortion stand. He subscribes to the belief that life begins at fertilization. This position would not only criminalize abortions in the case of rape and incest but would prohibit the use of contraceptive methods that are understood to prevent the uterine implantation of a fertilized egg like the intrauterine device and the morning-after pill. In 2012, when Cruz was running for the Senate, the Houston Chronicle reported that \u201cCruz would allow abortion only in cases in which the mother\u2019s life is in jeopardy\u201d and quoted him as saying \u201cI think that every human life is a precious gift from God and should be protected in law from conception until natural death.\u201d Cruz\u2019s opposition to abortion in the case of rape and incest is well to the right of the vast majority of voters, including most Republicans. One CNN poll found that 76 percent of Republican voters said abortions should be legal in cases of rape and incest; 22 percent said they should be illegal under such circumstances. Cruz is far outside the mainstream on a host of other issues. Not only does he advocate overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, but he faulted the Republican mayor of Dallas for participating in a gay pride celebration: \u201cWhen a mayor of a city chooses twice to march in a parade celebrating gay pride that\u2019s a statement and it\u2019s not a statement I agree with.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cruz calls for the partial privatization of Social Security, raising the retirement age and using a new formula to slow the growth of benefits. Cruz has declared that he is \u201cfully committed to repealing every single word of Obamacare\u201d and has attacked the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that expansion \u201cwill worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas.\u201d During his three years in Washington, Cruz has earned an unprecedented level of animosity from elites on both the left and right. What is really stunning to a longtime observer of Washington is the number of reputable people who have brutally criticized Cruz on the record. The New Republic recently published an extraordinary collection of anti-Cruz quotes that runs from the left through the center to the right. His colleagues are on record as hating him \u2014 hate may be too mild a description. First and foremost, he has angered virtually everyone he works with, especially his fellow Republican senators. A prime example took place on the Senate floor last July 24 when Cruz called Mitch McConnell, his majority leader, a liar, claiming that a McConnell promise about a key amendment was a \u201cflat out lie.\u201d Even more remarkable than the willingness of, say, Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, to declare that \u201cCruz isn\u2019t a good guy, and he\u2019d be impossible as president. People don\u2019t trust him,\u201d is the willingness of Republican lobbyists \u2014 men and women whose livelihoods depend on good relations with potential presidential administrations \u2014 to disparage Cruz. \u201cCruz is a leader of the \u2018purity caucus\u2019 that is obstinate, grandstanding and very un-Reagan like and very frustrating for his Senate colleagues,\u201d Ed Rogers, chairman of the BGR Group, one of the major lobbying firms, wrote to me in an email. John Feehery, president of Quinn Gillespie Communications, and a former top Republican staffer on Capitol Hill, was more outspoken: Cruz is an army of one, alienating anybody who is in his path. He advocates losing strategies purely to further his own career at the expense of the party. The second basis for Republican animosity toward Cruz is the widespread conviction that Cruz would not only lose in a landslide, but that he would bring the Republican Senate majority and many House Republicans down with him. \u201cIf he\u2019s the nominee, we\u2019re going to have wholesale losses in Congress and state offices and governors and legislatures,\u201d said Bob Dole, a former Senate majority leader and the Republican nominee in 1996. Cruz, more than any of the other Republican presidential candidates, including Trump, is ideally suited to mobilize every Democratic constituency, including single women, minorities, young voters and socially liberal professionals \u2014 with the possible exception of some Hispanic voters who would be drawn to a Cuban-American candidate. With Cruz as the nominee, Democrats could make substantial inroads among moderate and centrist Republican voters as well as married women. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cruz\u2019s appeal is restricted to core Republican constituencies, most of which are in decline as a percentage of the electorate. Married white Christians have steadily dropped from 80 percent of voters in the late 1950s to fewer than 40 percent now. In 1940, 82 percent of adults were members of the white working class; now that number is well below 30 percent. In the bleak demographic environment facing the Republican Party, Cruz offers little or no prospect of enlarging the party\u2019s base. Even if Cruz were to lick the 20-1 odds against him and win the presidency, his ability to accomplish any of his policy objectives would be severely constrained not only by Democrats but also by the legions of Republicans who hold him in contempt. Strategically, many in the Republican establishment had been looking favorably on Marco Rubio as their best \u2014 or least bad \u2014 choice. Rubio\u2019s disastrous performance in the most recent debate \u2014 and his fifth-place finish in New Hampshire \u2014 have, however, given renewed momentum to the unexpected willingness of Republican elected officials to back Trump in order to choke off Cruz\u2019s bid. Charles Black, a conservative lobbyist active in Republican presidential politics for half a century, told the Times before voting began this month that if Cruz were nominated, party leaders would \u201csit down and try to help Cruz run a better campaign, but he may not listen.\u201d In contrast, \u201cYou can coach Donald,\u201d Black said. \u201cIf he got nominated, he\u2019d be scared to death. That\u2019s the point he would call people in the party and say, \u2018I just want to talk to you.\u2019 \u201d For a deeply partisan Democrat, the strategic calculus is different. Hillary Clinton remains the favorite in national polls and can be expected to begin winning primaries starting on Feb. 27 when the battle moves South and she will likely get strong African-American support. In that case, the best choice for registered Democrats in states holding Republican primaries would be to switch parties and vote for Cruz on the theory that as a nominee he would shrink the Republican coalition. The Republican National Committee and other conservative groups are attempting a similar approach by supporting Bernie Sanders on the calculation that he would be a much weaker general election candidate than Clinton. If you think this is paranoia, take a look at the Twitter feeds during the Democratic debate on Jan. 17. Sean Spicer, the communications director for the Republican National Committee, repeatedly posted pro-Sanders tweets, including this one: This election cycle is the first in recent memory in which both parties are giving serious consideration to candidates like Trump, Cruz and Sanders, who would bring striking liabilities into the general election. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There have been many elections in which one party chose a lemon \u2014 Barry Goldwater, Bob Dole and Mitt Romney on the Republican side; George McGovern, Fritz Mondale and Michael Dukakis on the Democratic side \u2014 but none in which both parties have chosen candidates with severe electoral liabilities.

You can only say that if you treat Muslim Americans as an abstraction. President Obama, meanwhile, went to a mosque, looked into people\u2019s eyes and gave a wonderful speech reasserting their place as Americans. He\u2019s exuded this basic care and respect for the dignity of others time and time again. Let\u2019s put it this way: Imagine if Barack and Michelle Obama joined the board of a charity you\u2019re involved in. You\u2019d be happy to have such people in your community. Could you say that comfortably about Ted Cruz? The quality of a president\u2019s humanity flows out in the unexpected but important moments. Third, a soundness in his decision-making process. Over the years I have spoken to many members of this administration who were disappointed that the president didn\u2019t take their advice. But those disappointed staffers almost always felt that their views had been considered in depth. Obama\u2019s basic approach is to promote his values as much as he can within the limits of the situation. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, has been so blinded by his values that the reality of the situation does not seem to penetrate his mind. Take health care. Passing Obamacare was a mighty lift that led to two gigantic midterm election defeats. As Megan McArdle pointed out in her Bloomberg View column, Obamacare took coverage away from only a small minority of Americans. Sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers, destroy the health insurance business and levy massive new tax hikes. This is epic social disruption. To think you could pass Sanderscare through a polarized Washington and in a country deeply suspicious of government is to live in intellectual fairyland. President Obama may have been too cautious, especially in the Middle East, but at least he\u2019s able to grasp the reality of the situation. Fourth, grace under pressure. I happen to find it charming that Marco Rubio gets nervous on the big occasions \u2014 that he grabs for the bottle of water, breaks out in a sweat and went robotic in the last debate. It shows Rubio is a normal person. And I happen to think overconfidence is one of Obama\u2019s great flaws. But a president has to maintain equipoise under enormous pressure. Obama has done that, especially amid the financial crisis. After Saturday night, this is now an open question about Rubio.

To hear Sanders or Trump, Cruz and Ben Carson campaign is to wallow in the pornography of pessimism, to conclude that this country is on the verge of complete collapse. That\u2019s simply not true. We have problems, but they are less serious than those faced by just about any other nation on earth.

Unlike many current candidates, Obama has not appealed to those passions. No, Obama has not been temperamentally perfect. Too often he\u2019s been disdainful, aloof, resentful and insular. But there is a tone of ugliness creeping across the world, as democracies retreat, as tribalism mounts, as suspiciousness and authoritarianism take center stage. Obama radiates an ethos of integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance that I\u2019m beginning to miss, and that I suspect we will all miss a bit, regardless of who replaces him.",

Strange to say, this line hasn\u2019t changed at all despite the fact that we\u2019ve gained 5.7 million private-sector jobs since January 2014, which is when the Affordable Care Act went into full effect. Then there\u2019s the assertion that taxing the rich has terrible effects on economic growth, and conversely that tax cuts at the top can be counted on to produce an economic miracle. This doctrine was tested more than two decades ago, when Bill Clinton raised tax rates on high incomes; Republicans predicted disaster, but what we got was the economy\u2019s best run since the 1960s. It was tested again when George W. Bush cut taxes on the wealthy; Republicans predicted a \u201cBush boom,\u201d but actually got a lackluster expansion followed by the worst slump since the Great Depression. And it got tested a third time after President Obama won re-election, and tax rates at the top went up substantially; since then we\u2019ve gained eight million private-sector jobs. Oh, and there\u2019s also the spectacular failure of the Kansas experiment, where huge tax cuts have created a budget crisis without delivering any hint of the promised economic miracle. But Republican faith in tax cuts as a universal economic elixir has, if anything, grown stronger, with Mr. Rubio, in particular, going even further than the other candidates by promising to eliminate all taxes on capital gains. Meanwhile, on foreign policy the required G.O.P. position has become one of utter confidence in the effectiveness of military force. How did that work in Iraq? Never mind: The only reason anybody in the world fails to do exactly what America wants must be because our leadership is lily-livered if not treasonous. And diplomacy, no matter how successful, is denounced as appeasement. Not incidentally, the shared Republican stance on foreign policy is basically the same view Richard Hofstadter famously described in his essay \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics\u201d: Whenever America fails to impose its will on the rest of the world, it must be because it has been betrayed.

Bernie Sanders is much more of a one-note candidate, but at least his signature issue \u2014 rising inequality and the effects of money on politics \u2014 reflects real concerns.

So how did this happen to the G.O.P.? In a direct sense, I suspect that it has a lot to do with Foxification, the way Republican primary voters live in a media bubble into which awkward facts can\u2019t penetrate. But there must be deeper causes behind the creation of that bubble.

(Once in office, he in effect conceded that she had been right, and included the mandate in his initiative.) But the truth is, Mr. Sanders is just amplifying left-wing critiques of health reform that were already out there. And some of these critiques have merit. Others don\u2019t. Let\u2019s start with the good critiques, which involve coverage and cost. The number of uninsured Americans has dropped sharply, especially in states that have tried to make the law work. But millions are still uncovered, and in some cases high deductibles make coverage less useful than it should be. This isn\u2019t inherent in a non-single-payer system: Other countries with Obamacare-type systems, like the Netherlands and Switzerland, do have near-universal coverage even though they rely on private insurers. But Obamacare as currently constituted doesn\u2019t seem likely to get there, perhaps because it\u2019s somewhat underfunded.

Meanwhile, although cost control is looking better than even reform advocates expected, America\u2019s health care remains much more expensive than anyone else\u2019s. So yes, there are real issues with Obamacare. The question is how to address those issues in a politically feasible way. But a lot of what I hear from the left is not so much a complaint about how the reform falls short as outrage that private insurers get to play any role. The idea seems to be that any role for the profit motive taints the whole effort. That is, however, a really bad critique. Yes, Obamacare did preserve private insurance \u2014 mainly to avoid big, politically risky changes for Americans who already had good insurance, but also to buy support or at least quiescence from the insurance industry. But the fact that some insurers are making money from reform (and their profits are not, by the way, all that large) isn\u2019t a reason to oppose that reform. The point is to help the uninsured, not to punish or demonize insurance companies. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And speaking of demonization: One unpleasant, ugly side of this debate has been the tendency of some Sanders supporters, and sometimes the campaign itself, to suggest that anyone raising questions about the senator\u2019s proposals must be a corrupt tool of vested interests. Recently Kenneth Thorpe, a respected health policy expert and a longtime supporter of reform, tried to put numbers on the Sanders plan, and concluded that it would cost substantially more than the campaign says. He may or may not be right, although most of the health wonks I know have reached similar conclusions. But the campaign\u2019s policy director immediately attacked Mr. Thorpe\u2019s integrity: \u201cIt\u2019s coming from a gentleman that worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect somebody who worked for B.C.B.S. to come up with.\u201d Oh, boy. And let\u2019s be clear: This kind of thing can do real harm. The truth is that whomever the Democrats nominate, the general election is mainly going to be a referendum on whether we preserve the real if incomplete progress we\u2019ve made on health, financial reform and the environment. The last thing progressives should be doing is trash-talking that progress and impugning the motives of people who are fundamentally on their side.",

The $800,000 advance he got for his memoir \u2014 the one that fails to explain his trajectory on the union issue \u2014 is also not exactly typical. But he\u2019s been a terrible money manager, which he explains by saying that \u201cI didn\u2019t inherit any money.\u201d On the issues, Rubio says he has a new generation\u2019s answers to the nation\u2019s economic problems. The answers are mainly about reducing business taxes and regulations, but he says it in a much more youthful way. He\u2019s anti-choice, even for victims of rape and incest. Lately, he\u2019s taken to pointing to instances when he supported legislation that did include an exception. This is true.

Why do you think that happened? Uncharitable observers thought he wanted to cozy up to big Republican donors who like the idea. But maybe he was just \u2026 growing. He becomes one of the famous bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d pushing for immigration reform. Rubio is a valuable partner for the Gang, and he makes them pay with repeated concessions, including a very strong provision for additional border security.

Now it may sound absurd to cast a figure like Donald Trump, the much-married prince of tinsel and pasteboard, as a scourge of decadence rather than its embodiment. But don\u2019t just think about the word in moral or aesthetic terms. Think of it as a useful way of describing a society that\u2019s wealthy, powerful, technologically proficient \u2014 and yet seemingly unable to advance in the way that its citizens once took for granted. A society where people have fewer children and hold diminished expectations for the future, where institutions don\u2019t work particularly well but can\u2019t seem to be effectively reformed, where growth is slow and technological progress disappoints. A society that fights to a stalemate in its foreign wars, even as domestic debates repeat themselves without any resolution. A society disillusioned with existing religions and ideologies, but lacking new sources of meaning to take their place. This is how many Americans, many Westerners, experience their civilization in the early years of the 21st century. And both Trump and Bernie Sanders, in their very different ways, are telling us that we don\u2019t have to settle for it anymore.

Trump is offering nostalgia, but it\u2019s not a true reactionary\u2019s lament. He wants to take us back to a time when the future seemed great, amazing, fantastic. Likewise Sanders, except that in his case the glorious future is more midcentury Scandinavia than space age America. After Obamacare became law it seemed to many people that the welfare state project was basically complete, that the future of American liberalism mostly involved tweaking entitlements around the edges to keep them solvent. But Sanders is telling liberals, younger liberals especially, that the heroic age of liberalism isn\u2019t over yet, that they can have a welfare state that\u2019s far more amazing and fantastic than the one their forefathers constructed.

Those two, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, are equally objectionable for different reasons. Mr. Trump has neither experience in nor interest in learning about national security, defense or global trade.

At a meeting with The Times\u2019s editorial writers, Mr. Trump talked about the art of applause lines. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said of his events, \u201cif it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of, maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, \u2018We will build the wall!\u2019 and they go nuts.\u201d Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t about constitutional principles; it\u2019s about ambition.

His is a passionate exposition of liberalism \u2014 and yes, democratic socialism \u2014 in its most positive light. But, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents. For instance, Sanders\u2019s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders\u2019s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy. When Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House. Photo Interesting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states. There are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes. Furthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn\u2019t have a \u201csuper PAC\u201d and doesn\u2019t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like he is a nail with the \u201csocialist\u201d label and his proposal on new taxation.

In a successful effort to secure compliance, the right has institutionalized enforcement through such groups as Americans for Tax Reform, Freedom Works, the Club for Growth and the network of national and local Tea Party organizations. These watchdog groups ensure that Republicans toe the line, ready to foster \u2014 and finance \u2014 primary challenges against those who deviate from the party line.

A majority of economists surveyed in 2012 by the University of Chicago found that, despite Republican demands for austerity, the $831 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus legislation significantly reduced unemployment. Every Republican in the House voted against the bill on Feb. 13, 2009, as did 38 of 41 Republican senators on the same day. Republican opposition to raising taxes, in turn, resulted in a decade-long delay before the enactment last year of long-term Highway Trust Fund legislation. During the delay, the nation\u2019s infrastructure continued to decay, with one out of nine bridges considered structurally deficient; the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that airport overcrowding and delays cost the nation $22 billion annually; and 42 percent of major urban highways were congested. Similarly, Republican cuts to the I.R.S. budget have resulted in a loss of tax revenue. In an April 2015 speech, John Koskinen, the commissioner of the I.R.S., noted that over the previous five years, as the number of taxpayers has grown, the I.R.S. budget was pared by $1.2 billion (to $10.9 billion from $12.1 billion), its lowest level since 1998, adjusted for inflation. In addition to a sharp reduction in the quality of services to taxpayers \u2014 the I.R.S. in 2015 answered only 37 percent of taxpayer phone inquiries \u2014 Koskinen said that \u201cthe drop in audit and collection case closures this year will translate into a loss for the government of at least $2 billion in revenue that otherwise would have been collected.\u201d Republican rejection of climate change and global warming is having a substantial impact at both the national and state levels. In two votes on Nov. 17, 2015, for example, Senate Republicans voted by identical 49 to 3 margins to disapprove a proposed E.P.A. regulation of carbon pollution emissions and an E.P.A. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Two weeks later, House Republicans voted 231 to 10 to disapprove the greenhouse gas regulations and 231 to 2 to disapprove the carbon pollution emission guidelines. It is more interesting to see how climate change opposition plays out in Republican-controlled states facing the brunt of rising seawaters. In Florida, present and former state employees contend that the words \u201cclimate change\u201d have been banned from state documents, although Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, denies any such edict. In North Carolina, where communities along the Atlantic are threatened, the Legislature voted in 2012 to bar the state Coastal Resources Commission from defining \u201crates of sea-level change for regulatory purposes\u201d before July 1, 2016. The real estate industry was a major backer of the legislation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Mississippi this year, Republican leaders of the state House changed the electronic display board where the votes of members show up in lights. The new board puts all Republicans together, separate from all Democratic members, in what was interpreted locally as a mechanism for Philip Gunn, the speaker, to make sure all Republican members voted in unison on key bills. Both liberal and conservative orthodoxy have roots in the polarization of the electorate, a division in which each side holds the opposition in contempt. If there is a godfather of current Republican intransigence, it is William Kristol, the conservative strategist and editor of The Weekly Standard. In 1993, Kristol wrote a memo to Republican congressional leaders titled \u201cDefeating President Clinton\u2019s Health Care Proposal.\u201d In the memo, he flatly rejected all compromise strategies in negotiations with the Clinton administration: Any Republican urge to negotiate a \u201cleast bad\u201d compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momentary public credit for helping the president \u2018do something\u2019 about health care, should also be resisted. Instead, the first step in a bid to revive \u201ca newly bold and principled Republican politics,\u201d Kristol wrote, must be the unqualified political defeat of the Clinton health care proposal. Its rejection by Congress and the public would be a monumental setback for the president; and an incontestable piece of evidence that Democratic welfare-state liberalism remains firmly in retreat. During the Obama years, the Kristol strategy has become fully operational for Republicans dealing with administration proposals. The 2010 Republican vote against Obamacare was even stronger than the Republican opposition to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: unanimous in both the House and the Senate. The Republican strategy was summed up by Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who famously told National Journal in an Oct. 23, 2010, interview: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d In many ways, the Republican strategy of huge resistance has backfired on the party itself. As recently as 2001 to 2003, Gallup found that Republicans in Congress had favorability ratings in the high 40s to mid-50s, consistently better than their unfavorable ratings.

Trump, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, about the heroin and prescription-painkiller abuse in his state. He thinks that the overdose problem has been severely underestimated, not just in his city and state, but nationwide. \u201cI just don\u2019t think anybody, until you put the numbers and talk to them about it, knows that it\u2019s this bad across this country,\u201d he said. Nearly 50 years into the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which both Republican and Democratic leaders have waged in various ways, with various disastrous outcomes, drug overdoses reached a record high in 2014. From 2001 to 2014, the United States had more than a threefold increase in deaths from opioid pain relievers, and a sixfold increase in heroin overdoses, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the same period, overdose deaths from prescription drugs like Valium and Klonopin \u2014 sedatives called benzodiazepines \u2014 increased by five times. In speaking about their own experiences, Republican candidates are not only allowing themselves to be vulnerable in front of voters, they\u2019re also straying from the just-say-no message of Ronald Reagan, whose legacy includes a tough legislative stance on drugs and drug sentencing. They\u2019re also hoping that voters, especially in early primary states, will empathize. Photo Grant Smith, a lobbyist with Drug Policy Action, said it was remarkable how much airtime addiction was getting. \u201cIf you look over the last two decades, we\u2019ve definitely seen a transformation in how elected officials talk about people who use drugs,\u201d he said. Now there\u2019s more empathy, less scolding. He is glad to see the new rhetoric about addiction, but notes that candidates have become more open about this issue as it has started to take a real toll on largely white communities. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the shift in who is being impacted by overdose and the attendant harms of drug use to rural and suburban communities has made lawmakers as well as candidates for office more comfortable talking about these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that African-American communities have endured high overdose rates for decades, and few lawmakers in Washington cared.\u201d At a forum at Southern New Hampshire University earlier this month, Governor Kasich spoke with refreshing candor about what some call this \u201cgentrification of addiction.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cSometimes I wonder how African-Americans must have felt when drugs were awash in their community and nobody watched,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s in our communities, and now all of a sudden we\u2019ve got forums, and God bless us, but think about the struggles that other people had.\u201d So far, the proposed plans from the candidates to combat addiction have remained frustratingly vague. Mr. Bush\u2019s plan is one exception: It would increase access to drug courts, which allow some nonviolent drug offenders to undergo medical treatment instead of serving jail time, and would also reduce some mandatory minimum sentences. Beyond criminal justice reform, there is the public health aspect of providing assistance. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to cover treatment for substance abuse. The Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare should answer this question: If you succeed, how will you fund treatment for drug users?

The Drug Enforcement Administration, formally if not informally, still considers marijuana more dangerous and more addictive than the prescription painkillers and sedatives that accounted for more than 25,000 overdose deaths in 2014. In Manchester, as Mayor Gatsas welcomes a parade of candidates, he also sees plenty of constituents dealing with the ravages of addiction. Mothers crying, parents writing obituaries that frankly state that their sons and daughters died from heroin overdoses. \u201cWith this epidemic, it\u2019s crossed every boundary. It\u2019s young to old, rich to poor, white to black,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018If it hasn\u2019t affected you yet, just wait. It will.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s a universal issue \u2014 which is something the candidates are starting to realize too.",

        "parsed_article": "First, like it or not, incumbent players have a lot of power. Private insurers played a major part in killing health reform in the early 1990s, so this time around reformers went for a system that preserved their role and gave them plenty of new business. Second, single-payer would require a lot of additional tax revenue \u2014 and we would be talking about taxes on the middle class, not just the wealthy. It\u2019s true that higher taxes would be offset by a sharp reduction or even elimination of private insurance premiums, but it would be difficult to make that case to the broad public, especially given the chorus of misinformation you know would dominate the airwaves. Finally, and I suspect most important, switching to single-payer would impose a lot of disruption on tens of millions of families who currently have good coverage through their employers. You might say that they would end up just as well off, and it might well be true for most people \u2014 although not those with especially good policies. But getting voters to believe that would be a very steep climb. What this means, as the health policy expert Harold Pollack points out, is that a simple, straightforward single-payer system just isn\u2019t going to happen. Even if you imagine a political earthquake that eliminated the power of the insurance industry and objections to higher taxes, you\u2019d still have to protect the interests of workers with better-than-average coverage, so that in practice single-payer, American style, would be almost as kludgy as Obamacare. Which brings me to the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to bypass these obstacles. It was careful to preserve and even enlarge the role of private insurers. Its measures to cover the uninsured rely on a combination of regulation and subsidies, rather than simply on an expansion of government programs, so that the on-budget cost is limited \u2014 and can, in fact, be covered without raising middle-class taxes. Perhaps most crucially, it leaves employer-based insurance intact, so that the great majority of Americans have experienced no disruption, in fact no change in their health-care experience. Even so, achieving this reform was a close-run thing: Democrats barely got it through during the brief period when they controlled Congress. Is there any realistic prospect that a drastic overhaul could be enacted any time soon \u2014 say, in the next eight years? No. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

There are many items on the progressive agenda, ranging from an effective climate change policy, to making college affordable for all, to restoring some of the lost bargaining power of workers. Making progress on any of these items is going to be a hard slog, even if Democrats hold the White House and, less likely, retake the Senate. Indeed, room for maneuver will be limited even if a post-Trump Republican Party moves away from the scorched-earth opposition it offered President Obama. So progressives must set some priorities. And it\u2019s really hard to see, given this picture, why it makes any sense to spend political capital on a quixotic attempt at a do-over, not of a political failure, but of health reform \u2014 their biggest victory in many years.",

This week she connected him \u2014 legislatively \u2014 to the Charleston church shooting and then suggested that his health care plan might endanger Medicare. Not taking this lying down, Sanders \u2026 made a negative ad. I know, this doesn\u2019t sound heart-stopping. There\u2019s a Ted Cruz ad suggesting that while ISIS prepares to destroy America, Marco Rubio plays fantasy football. Sanders\u2019s ad doesn\u2019t even mention Clinton by name.

Do you think Sanders is saying it\u2019s unfair to take money from big banks and then regulate the heck out of them? Or that you shouldn\u2019t take their money in the first place? Probably the latter, but it\u2019s not exactly an attention-grabber when Republicans are running spots calling each other a \u201cbully\u201d or a \u201cjerk.\u201d (Both of those were aimed at Donald Trump, and I believe I speak for much of the nation when I say, \u201cWhy not?\u201d) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sanders has been stressing his war on Wall Street, but now Clinton is lacing out at his health care plan, which is basically universal Medicare.

But I most appreciated in this speech his willingness to home in on what bugs so many of us who follow politics: political polarization, unwillingness to compromise, gerrymandering, denial of basic science, and a bitter, partisan negativity that has corroded the social fabric of American life. But then, as he does so well, right after that miserable list of sour notes, he immediately shifted into his exhortation to get involved. In his own version of John F.

Baumgartner\u2019s view was echoed by a number of other scholars I contacted. \u201cIt comes purely from a strategic political calculus,\u201d according to Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego: The federal government has become more progressive over its history in the case of slavery, the New Deal, the civil rights advances from 1957-1965, and the environmental regulations of the 1970s. When you lose battles at the national level but still hold sway in many states, taking a stand for states\u2019 rights becomes the rational thing to do. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed seems to be the result of the relatively recent nationalization of state campaign financing,\u201d Morgan Kousser, a professor of history at Caltech (and, as it happens, Thad Kousser\u2019s father), wrote in an email: The Koch brothers understand the importance of controlling state legislatures; George Soros doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure why this should be the case, but since we\u2019re really talking about a relatively small number of mega-donors who have caused this, it\u2019s a rather restricted question. Liberal foundations, in the view of Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America foundation, have for a long time got perpetually distracted by fads and short-term metrics, whereas conservative foundations were willing to invest much more in long-term organizational capacity. \u201cHow the Right Trounced Liberals in the States,\u201d by Alexander Hertel-Fernandez and Theda Skocpol, in the Winter edition of the journal Democracy, documents the failure of the left to keep pace with the substantial investments by the right in building local organizations. Liberals, according to Hertel-Fernandez, a graduate student at Harvard, and Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology there, \u201chave left behind little more than a litany of abandoned acronyms.\u201d The authors provide several examples of such failures: The National Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies \u201cfaded and by the 1980s, CASLP\u2019s founder had moved on to other projects.\u201d The Center for Policy Alternatives \u201cclosed its doors in 2008.\u201d The Progressive States Network \u201cnever reached the levels attained by\u201d its conservative counterparts. They go on to note that left initiatives have lost traction as liberal funders switch to a nascent competitor. In many ways, the funding problem has gotten worse now that unions are struggling with declining dues-paying memberships and adverse legal decisions that threaten their very existence. Why do trends at the local level contrast with trends at the national level, where Democrats have made substantial gains in the competition for political money? Sixteen years ago, in 2000, the Republican National, Senatorial and Congressional Committees outraised their Democratic counterparts by nearly $300 million, $923 million to $631 million. George W. Bush spent $172.1 million to Al Gore\u2019s $127.1 million. Four years ago, in 2012, the Democratic national committees raised $1.07 billion to the Republicans\u2019 $1.02 billion. The Obama campaign spent $632 million to Mitt Romney\u2019s $389 million. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Away from the national level, the commitment of conservative donors to support a power shift in state government illustrates the determination of the right to eliminate regulatory and legal constraints on markets where their money has proven most productive. Attempts to control the White House have become far more risky with the rise of a strong Democratic presidential coalition. In 2012, conservative groups put $700 million in a bid to win the presidency, two and a half times as much as liberal groups, but Obama still won decisively. The states, it turns out, are more receptive to the drive of the Koch Companies and their corporate allies to protect their business interests. The Koch brothers\u2019 have invested in such state-regulated areas as refining, chemicals, biofuels and ingredients; forest products; fertilizers; polymers and fibers. For the extractive industries, in particular, along with chemical, pharmaceutical, and lumber concerns, Republican-led deregulatory efforts can increase profits. Wealthy liberal donors, on the other hand, are driven by ideological convictions that can be volatile and vulnerable, as Hertel-Fernandez and Skocpol put it, \u201cto shifting donor fashions.\u201d In addition, investing in such national liberal causes as refugee resettlement, climate change, gay marriage, and voting rights has the appeal of participation on a high visibility issue \u2014 with the likelihood of public acclaim. Investing in state organizations provides far fewer public rewards. The willingness of conservatives to weather difficulty and to endure prolonged delay has been demonstrated repeatedly over the past decades. In 1973, as the Watergate scandal was closing in on the Nixon administration, conservatives financed the creation of two institutions: the Heritage Foundation to counter the left on national policy, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) to foster state-based conservative lobbies, interest groups and foundations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was no short term advantage. In 1974, Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and four in the Senate. Republicans also lost over 700 seats in state legislatures, leaving them at their lowest level since 1938. After the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, Democrats were back in power in Washington. Conservative donors were undaunted. ALEC and Heritage continued to grow. When the right came back in full force in the election of 1980, Heritage was ready to offer a guiding hand. Once Ronald Reagan took office, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s legislative blueprint, \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d became the Reagan administration\u2019s \u201cpolicy bible.\u201d The elections of 2006 and 2008, in turn, were interpreted as sounding the death knell for conservatism. \u201cThe new Democratic majority assembled by Obama represents the emergence of a Great Society electoral coalition,\u201dPhilip Klinkner and Thomas Schaller, political scientists at Hamilton and the University of Maryland\u2014Baltimore County, argued in the January 2009 edition of The Forum. Nonetheless, conservatives maintained their investment in building state-level infrastructure, not only in ALEC but in the State Policy Network and the interlocking foundations created by Charles and David Koch. The total investment of the right in state and local organizations now reaches well into the hundreds of millions. In 2013, ALEC had a relatively modest budget of $7.3 million. That figure, however, distracts from a much larger investment by the right. When the State Policy Network was founded in 1986, it had 12 affiliated state-based groups and a goal of creating an \u201cinterstate freedom network\u201d to spread \u201cthe growth of freedom across America until a permanent freedom majority is built.\u201d Today, there are one or more affiliated organizations in every state. An examination of IRS reports from all of these conservative groups shows total spending in just one year, 2013, of $142.2 million, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s $8.9 million the largest expenditure. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The State Policy Network\u2019s single year total of $142.2 million is dwarfed by the network of foundations financed by Charles and David Koch and allied donors, individual and corporate. The complex transactions between the foundations in the Koch Brothers network obscure the dollar amount of their investments in state and local organizations. But the Koch Companies\u2019 June Quarterly Newsletter notes that the Koch brothers \u201chope to raise $889 million by the end of 2016, about two-thirds of which will help support research and education programs, scholarships and other efforts designed to change policies and promote a culture of freedom in the United States.\u201d When Republicans swept the House and Senate in 2010, the earlier investments paid off. ALEC, the State Policy Network and the Koch foundations had a ready-made conservative agenda for newly empowered Republican legislators and governors, an agenda that has produced an upheaval in environmental regulation, labor law, voting rights and reproductive rights. Conservatives have some inherent advantages in building a state and local infrastructure. Rob Stein, a founder of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a \u201cpartnership\u201d of liberal donors established in 2005 \u2014 pointed out in a phone interview that the right can tap into an embedded structure of community-based cultural, religious, social organizations \u2014 churches, Elks, veterans halls, gun groups, local business organizations, etc. \u2014 that are gathering places with offices, meeting halls, phones and computers that can be used by activist troops for logistical and operational support. Stein, who has worked in the field for decades, said that the result for conservatives is that your volunteers and paid activists come out of a values-based institution, which is essentially not a political institution. People are there because of their values. If you come to politics from a club or church or veterans hall, it reinforces the stickiness of your work, your willingness to keep at it even if you are tired. By comparison, Stein argued, \u201cprogressives don\u2019t have these community based, indigenous resources to educate, organize and mobilize troops anymore.\u201d With the exception of unions, \u201cwe have fewer local places to gather and belong.\u201d While organized labor remains influential in state elections, membership has collapsed to 6.6 percent in the private sector, and public sector unions are under sustained assault. This week, the five-member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court appeared prepared to deal another blow to the union movement in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. In 2004, major liberal donors financed two new national groups created specifically for the 2004 presidential election \u2014 Americans Coming Together ($79,795,487) and the Joint Victory Committee ($71,811,666). Despite the investment, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, lost. At that point, the liberal donor community came to general agreement that the left needed a secure a permanent infrastructure at the national level to compete with such conservative institutions as the Chamber of Commerce, the American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Tax Reform and Heritage. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A year later, Democracy Alliance established its goal of building a \u201cprogressive infrastructure that could help counter the well-funded and sophisticated conservative apparatus in the areas of civic engagement, leadership, media, and ideas.\u201d At a national level, the alliance has played a significant role in the development of such groups as the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank; Catalist, which builds and maintains voter lists; and Media Matters, which seeks to document and discredit \u201cconservative misinformation throughout the media.\u201d Last year, the alliance initiated a program to direct a portion of members\u2019 contributions to state and local groups. I emailed Gara LaMarche, the president of the alliance, to ask how reliable alliance members are in continuing their support of relatively low-visibility state organizations. His answer: By our best accounting, at the end of last year DA Partners gave about $15 million to these funds, on top of the almost $60 million they committed to the other DA Portfolio groups. LaMarche described the response as encouraging, noting that the alliance aims \u201cto at least double the contributions to the funds in 2016.\u201d LaMarche voiced some confidence that \u201cDA donors will stay the course.\u201d He acknowledged that our Partners don\u2019t have the bottom line personal or corporate financial interest that fuels a good deal of the right\u2019s giving, but I believe they increasingly get the importance and urgency of the state-level work, where the right has made such gains \u2014 with such damage to the progressive agenda \u2014 in recent years. During our conversation, Stein, who had helped start the organization, raised some doubts: It has begun to appear that the twenty-first century progressive brain is not as interested in clubs, communities and cultural sharing as the conservative brain is. How, Stein asked, \u201ccould we have lost that? How does a communitarian world view lose its communitarian sense of self?\u201d The short answer to Stein\u2019s question may be that the nature of political liberalism has changed. The liberalism of the 1930s and 1940s was shaped by the Great Depression, and the response was, in many respects, communitarian: the strengthening of unions, the provision of jobs and government benefits to the poor and unemployed and the creation of a safety net to provide a modicum of security. The left has, in part, shifted focus, with more stress on the values of self-expression and self-fulfillment, on individual liberation from the constraints of traditional morality, especially sexual morality \u2014 what my colleague Ross Douthat calls \u201cThe Liberalism of Adult Autonomy\u201d or \u201cthe morality of rights.\u201d Economic liberalism \u2013 despite progress on the minimum wage - has lost salience. Instead of communitarian principles, the contemporary progressive movement \u2014 despite its advocacy of local issues like community policing \u2014 has produced a counterpart to conservative advocacy of free markets: the advocacy of personal freedom. Insofar as liberals continue to leave the state-level organization to conservatives, they are conceding the most productive policy arenas in the country.

The passage of Obamacare in 2010 was the last such initiative. States are the place where new programs and policies are emerging on an almost weekly basis.

The losses for the Democratic Party and its allies include broken unions, defunded Planned Parenthood, lost wetlands and forests, restrictive abortion regulations and the proliferation of open-carry gun laws. While the presidential race captures our attention \u2013 and as the left has withdrawn from low-level combat \u2014 conservatives have overseen the drawing of legislative and congressional districts that will keep Republicans in power over the next decade. In this way, through the most effective gerrymandering of legislative and congressional districts in the nation\u2019s history, the right has institutionalized a dangerous power vacuum on the left.",

He signed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform, which critics claimed would crush employment by starving businesses of capital. He raised taxes on high incomes, especially at the very top, where average tax rates rose by about six and a half percentage points after 2012, a step that critics claimed would destroy incentives. And he enacted a health reform that went into full effect in 2014, amid claims that it would have catastrophic effects on employment. Photo Yet none of the dire predicted consequences of these policies have materialized. It\u2019s not just that overall job creation in the private sector \u2014 which was what Mr. Obama was supposedly killing \u2014 has been strong. More detailed examinations of labor markets also show no evidence of predicted ill effects. For example, there\u2019s no evidence that Obamacare led to a shift from full-time to part-time work, and no evidence that the expansion of Medicaid led to large reductions in labor supply. So what do we learn from this impressive failure to fail? That the conservative economic orthodoxy dominating the Republican Party is very, very wrong. In a way, that should have been obvious. For conservative orthodoxy has a curiously inconsistent view of the abilities and motivations of corporations and wealthy individuals \u2014 I mean, job creators. On one side, this elite is presumed to be a bunch of economic superheroes, able to deliver universal prosperity by summoning the magic of the marketplace. On the other side, they\u2019re depicted as incredibly sensitive flowers who wilt in the face of adversity \u2014 raise their taxes a bit, subject them to a few regulations, or for that matter hurt their feelings in a speech or two, and they\u2019ll stop creating jobs and go sulk in their tents, or more likely their mansions. It\u2019s a doctrine that doesn\u2019t make much sense, but it conveys a clear message that, whaddya know, turns out to be very convenient for the elite: namely, that injustice is a law of nature, that we\u2019d better not do anything to make our society less unequal or protect ordinary families from financial risks. Because if we do, the usual suspects insist, we\u2019ll be severely punished by the invisible hand, which will collapse the economy.

After all, America achieved rapid, indeed unprecedented, income growth in the 1950s and 1960s, despite top tax rates beyond the wildest dreams of modern progressives. For that matter, there are countries like Denmark that combine high taxes and generous social programs with very good employment performance. But for those who don\u2019t know much about either history or the world outside America, the Obama economy offers a powerful lesson in the here and now. From a conservative point of view, Mr. Obama did everything wrong, afflicting the comfortable (slightly) and comforting the afflicted (a lot), and nothing bad happened. We can, it turns out, make our society better after all.",

        "parsed_article": "Photo Republican and Democratic governors in several states that have refused to expand their Medicaid programs are now seeking to do so, but will need approval from Republican-dominated legislatures. Even if they are not moved by humanitarian concerns to improve health care for their poorest citizens, recalcitrant legislators should at least see the folly of rejecting extremely generous matching funds. The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for newly eligible enrollees in 2016 and 95 percent in 2017, phasing down to 90 percent in 2020 and subsequent years. Thus far 30 states and the District of Columbia have expanded their Medicaid programs and 20 have not, although several of them are debating whether to do so. Some of the states that expanded were given federal waivers to use conservative approaches, like using Medicaid money to pay for private insurance. In several states that have not expanded or are still debating, pragmatic Republican governors find themselves at odds with ideologues in Congress and with right-wing groups that want to destroy Obamacare at all costs. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, now seeking the Republican nomination for president, was one of the first to see the wisdom of expanding Medicaid to bring in billions of dollars in federal matching funds. When Republicans who dominated the legislature balked, he bypassed them with a tactical maneuver that allowed a separate board to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid without legislative approval. He calls this the right thing to do, fiscally and morally, as it surely is. No governors should deny health coverage for people just because they are ideologically opposed to federal entitlement programs. The Republican governors of South Dakota and Wyoming and the Democratic governor of Virginia have included Medicaid expansion in their state budgets, suggesting a strong desire to get their hands on federal matching funds if only they can wrest approval from their legislatures. Virginia appears a lost cause, but the other two states are up for grabs. In Louisiana, term-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal blocked expansion last year, but was succeeded by a Democrat who vows to quickly enroll about 300,000 more people on top of the 1.4 million already enrolled. In Arkansas, where a centrist Democratic governor used federal money to buy private coverage for more than 200,000 people in 2013, his Republican successor wants to continue the expansion. In Kentucky, a new Republican governor who vowed to roll back the big expansion ordered by his Democratic predecessor is having second thoughts now that he is responsible for the health of his constituents. Elsewhere the forces of reaction remain busily at work. In Utah, a Republican governor who had futilely tried to get expansion approved by the Legislature gave up this year and did not include expansion in his budget. Both Republican senators from Utah are opposed to expansion. And in Florida, where the Legislature has blocked expansion, there is a campaign to amend the state Constitution to require the state to accept federal funds for expansion. It is considered a long shot whether the campaign can gather almost 700,000 signatures by Feb. 1 to put the measure on the ballot during the 2016 presidential campaign. It appears to be the last hope for hundreds of thousands of poor Floridians.",

Well, I\u2019m a big geek; like quite a few other people who work on policy issues, I was eagerly awaiting the I.R.S.\u2019s tax tables for 2013, which were released last week. And what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences. You might think that this is obvious. But on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what President Obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. Whoever the next president is, they assert \u2014 or at least, whoever it is if it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders \u2014 things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. And it\u2019s true that if you were expecting Mr. Obama to preside over a complete transformation of America\u2019s political and economic scene, what he\u2019s actually achieved can seem like a big letdown. But the truth is that Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. Which brings me to those I.R.S. tables. For one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that Mr. Obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. Partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the Bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Advertisement Continue reading the main story If Mitt Romney had won, we can be sure that Republicans would have found a way to prevent these tax hikes. And we can now see what happened because he didn\u2019t. According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.",
